    "description": "This updated and revised edition offers a comprehensive overview of key research methods and the main choices available when undertaking research in business and management. New to this edition is a comprehensive, practical guide on how to write your dissertation - invaluable to all. It is a clear, concise and practical guide containing wealth of outstanding examples for each method covered.Central to this edition is the 'methods map' (chapter 4), which sets out a logical process for researchers to articulate their position in relation to five key aspects of their research philosophy. In addition, the editors have developed a free app to accompany the book and this enables novice researchers to quickly develop a comprehensive justification of their particular research design in an interactive way. Taking you through the entire life cycle of a dissertation, the text covers everything from the purposes of research through to chapters on gathering primary and secondary data; using literature; quantitative and qualitative research; managing your research; using data and research ethics. Individual chapters are allied to a powerful critical commentary showing how some of the world's leading scholars have used particular methods in their own research. Carefully constructed to achieve the greatest clarity for the student the text gives the reader: * In-text exercises * End of chapter' review questions with solutions* Exemplar papers identified and discussed for each of the main methods *Directed further reading for developing understanding in key areas It is an essential learning aid for upper level undergraduates and postgraduates across a wide range of business and management courses and it comes with a range of supported learning materials including tutorials, lecture slides and tutor notes.Kevin O'Gorman is Professor of Management and Business History and Head of Business Management in the School of Languages and Management in Heriot-Watt University, Edinburgh.

    "description": "Beloved author and teacher Alan Cohen (A Course in Miracles Made Easy) uses his idiosyncratic, insightful spin on spiritual wisdom to show that we can enjoy significant career and financial success and be true to our passion and soul's calling. Can you be both a spiritual seeker and a seeker after success in the world? Best-selling author and teacher Alan Cohen knows it's possible. In coaching and leading seminars for thousands of people over many years, Alan has identified three groups of people who struggle with issues of money, prosperity, and spiritual life. This book is written to help them all find a spiritually sound path to the success they desire. The first group comprises those who have corporate or other well-paying jobs with lots of benefits but are miserable because they work in impersonal environments and their industries are consumed with profits rather than people; their souls are starving for meaning and contribution. The second is entrepreneurs who have created a livelihood with meaning but are sweating to make their income support them. The third group is made up of artistic, creative, alternative-culture spiritual aficionados who don't care much about earning money and do not have business skills--but they still have to generate an income, so they struggle to pay their bills. Spirit Means Business speaks to all three groups, demonstrating that it is possible to achieve big career success and enjoy passion and soul fulfillment. Alan identifies the 10 primary illusions that keep people separated from spirit and prosperity, then shows readers how to overcome these illusions with higher principles that always work when we apply them consciously. The book includes many down-to-earth examples of individuals who have combined soul and success, plus many crisp, clear formulas to bridge the gaps and surmount the hurdles along the way.",

The authors’ motivation for writing this book is to give users the tools and insight to make the most effective forecasts. Ord/Fildes PRINCIPLES OF BUSINESS FORECASTING, 1E, International Edition is designed for users who have taken a first course in applied statistics or have an equivalent background and provides an introduction to both standard and advanced forecasting approaches. This new, first edition text presents general principles that are the basis of forecasting practice. The information and data used are from actual government and business sources wherever possible. Forecasting techniques are shown in a variety of software platforms and the chapter organization provides an overview of forecasting in a variety of situations using time series and cross-sectional data. The focus then shifts to using extrapolative methods in forecasting, followed by statistical model-building. Finally, the authors cover more advanced techniques in the latter chapters, including the selection of the best forecasting method based on available data and the construction of a forecasting system with an organization.",

    "description": "This book demonstrates, in detail, why annual performance appraisals might still work in hierarchical environments, but largely fail in agile ones. The annual performance appraisal is one of the world’s most widely used management tools. For many years, it was indeed seen as a pre-requisite for successful leadership and professional management. While most managers and employees have always been sceptical in this respect, those at a strategic level are now also realising it causes more harm than good, and a growing number of leading companies have similarly abolished this approach. One key reason lies in the changing working world, and the quest for greater organisational agility. Companies are moving away from rigid structuring. The arguments are presented objectively but with practical relevance, coherently illustrating the available alternatives for achieving what annual performance appraisals largely have not.",

Beyond point-and-click The goal of the Exploring series is to move students beyond the point-and-click, to understanding the why and how behind each skill. And because so much learning takes place outside of the classroom, this series provides learning tools that students can access anywhere, anytime. Students go to college now with a different set of skills than they did years ago. With this in mind, the Exploring series seeks to move students beyond the basics of the software at a faster pace, without sacrificing coverage of the fundamental skills that everyone needs to know. Also available with MyITLab MyITLab ® is an online homework, tutorial, and assessment program designed for Information Technology (IT) courses, which engages students and improves results. HTML5 Simulation exercises and Live-in-Application Grader projects come with the convenience of auto-grading and instant feedback, helping students learn more quickly and effectively. Digital badges lets students showcase their Microsoft Office or Computer Concepts competencies, keeping them motivated and focused on their future careers. MyITLab builds the critical skills needed for college and career success. Note: You are purchasing a standalone product; MyITLab does not come packaged with this content.

    "description": "This fully revised and updated 2nd edition of Human Resource Management: A Global and Critical Perspective builds on the previous edition’s success to bring an even sharper exploration of HRM in a real-world global context. With a critical approach that is woven into the chapters and encourages students to question assumptions in HRM, there is a consistent focus on the impact of globalization, the ways in which theory has addressed the implications of a globalized workforce, and the way HRM works in multinational corporations. Boasting a truly global orientation which is removed from the typically western-centric approach, this textbook draws on the expert knowledge of chapter authors from around the world, combining international case studies with a strong offering of pedagogical features. Yet while this textbook is designed to engage the student and elicit independent thought, it also adopts a rigorous academic level which is grounded in the very latest research. New to this edition: Brand new chapters: Talent Management; International Assignments; Managing Global and Migrant Workers; Sustainable HRM Revised and refreshed international case studies, including a mini-case at the start of each chapter and end of chapter case studies focused on an array of diverse, mostly non-western, regions of the world An innovative offering of pedagogical features, including critical discussions, action-orientated activities designed to engage students in transferable skill development, ‘In the News’ segments exploring contemporary issues, and ‘Stop and Reflect’ boxes to encourage critical thinking skills This is a core textbook for general business and management degrees, specialist HRM degrees, and international business degrees. It is an ideal companion for students at both undergraduate and postgraduate level.",

    "description": "In the modern world, data is wealth. The world's largest taxi company owns no cars, the world's largest retailer owns no inventory, and the world's largest accommodation provider owns no real estate. What they hold instead is data. And it is data, almost exclusively, which generates them huge revenues. Yet many people have not thought through the implications of how these business models work or where to profit from them. Aimed at business professionals looking to understand and develop business opportunities surrounding data and data storage, \"Where Data is Wealth\" examines the trends, technology, market direction, and openings currently available. It provides a concise, real-world look at the changing face of data technology and where the best opportunities lie. J. Bruce Daley, an industry insider with more than 30 years in the business, makes a powerful case that whilst compute and networking have traditionally held center stage, the incredible increases in data volumes now means that data and data storage is where to make investments, offer new products and services, or build a career. In turn, he details the hazards of digital wealth (and how it could disappear in an instant!), how a disrupted storage market can make you money, and even help you get a job. \"About The Author.\" J. Bruce Daley writes, speaks, and consults about ways to profit from new software technologies. He helps organizations make better business decisions when buying and implementing technology, advises investors on achieving greater returns from investments, and aids individuals in learning new skills and discovering new opportunities. He also helps technology vendors anticipate new business opportunities, market demands, and customer needs. \"Having known and worked with Bruce Daley for many years, I know there are few who know as much about data - and how to apply it to the creation of wealth - than he does.\" Chris Selland, VP Business Development, Big Data Platform, Hewlett Packard Enterprise. \"Software is headed to being silicon.It's not easy to build, but that's not where the value is. Instead the value is going to be in the data the software can acquire and analyze. Bruce's book is a great start on your journey to understanding the power of data.\" Tim Chou, Author and Lecturer at Stanford University. \"In our society you can't be too thin, too rich, or have too much data. This book won't help you lose weight, but it will help you with the other two.\" Dave Sutton, CEO and Author. \"We have triggered an information technology Big Bang. Bruce Daley understands that data is the new gravity for the connected world and what that means in business today.\" Marc L. Songini, Author, Former High Tech Journalist and Analyst.\"",

It includes coverage of the increasing role of knowledge management as well as how to conduct information-gathering activities more effectively in a rapidly changing business environment. Because managers increasingly must make decisions based on almost unlimited information in data warehouses, this text provides substantially more coverage of data analysis than other texts. The authors recognize that most managers will not be data analysts. The straightforward, hands-on approach will make the book particularly successful in teaching advanced undergraduates and MBA students, both traditional and executive.",

Zusätzlich haben Kommunikationstechnik und -kanäle in den letzten Jahren die Medien revolutioniert und gängige Marketingkonzepte völlig auf den Kopf gestellt. Die Kunden lassen sich nicht mehr mit Werbebotschaften berieseln, sie reden plötzlich mit – und wie! Bisweilen mit katastrophalen Folgen für Firmen, die die Wucht von Facebook, Twitter & Co. unterschätzen oder deren großartige Potenziale liegen lassen. Häufig fehlen klare Strategien und Konzeptionen, ein professioneller Ansatz ist oft nicht zu erkennen. In dieser völlig überarbeiteten und erweiterten Neuauflage beschreiben Experten namhafter deutscher Unternehmen und Hochschulen anhand von Best-Practice-Beispielen, wie es gelingt, in Zeiten globalen Wettbewerbs und steigender Online-Kommunikation konzeptionell nachhaltig aufgestellt zu sein. Lassen Sie sich inspirieren!",

Diese wurde durch die Regelungen zur Corporate Governance neu belebt. Auch sorgen die vielfältigen Beratungs- und Counterpartaufgaben beider Akteure für Berührungspunkte. Auf das große Potential der Zusammenarbeit von Controllerbereich und Innenrevision wurde zwar schon oft hingewiesen, doch wurde das Thema bisher nicht fundiert untersucht. Auf der Grundlage einer großzahligen Befragung von Controllingleitern analysiert Holger Birl Erfolgswirkung und Einflussfaktoren einer Kooperation von Controllern und Innenrevisoren und zeigt, dass sich die Kooperation positiv auf die Qualität der Controllerleistungen auswirkt. Die detaillierte Auswertung der unterschiedlichen Teildimensionen der Qualität der Controllerleistung bietet neue interessante Einblicke in die Wirkungsweise kooperativen Verhaltens beider Akteure.",

Essential to organizational design is the assumption that it can improve organizations. Faced with the ever-accelerating pace of technological change and the restructuring of markets, many firms have been questioning their own organization. This book is the third to emerge from a series of workshops on organization design, featuring new empirical research and theoretical insights. The chapters are organized around four central themes: 1) Towards New Organizational Forms, 2) Dynamics of Adaptation and Change, 3) Theoretical and Practical issues, 4) Fit and Performance. Collectively, the chapters reflect the state of the art of OD as well as provide a further step towards the evolution of this important field of research.",

Auf der Passivseite der Überschuldungsbilanz geht er dabei vor allem auf die Besonderheiten der Behandlung von Rückstellungen ein.",

My own story (1919) first tells Older's story as the editor of the struggling Bulletin in 1895. He provides fascinating details of his fight against political corruption in San Francisco in the next fifteen years, a chronicle of graft, labor violence, fraud, and rampant bribery centering on his fight against the Southern Pacific Railroad and its political \"ring\" and personal battles with Republican boss Abraham Ruef, Mayor Eugene Schmitz, and Patrick Calhoun, head of United Railroads.",

Zum Eventmanagement gehört die Frage, was ein Event auszeichnet, wie man eine Veranstaltung durch einen Zusatzeffekt in den Augen der Besucher einzigartig macht und wie man ein solches Event in der Praxis umsetzt. Das Buch führt in die Grundlagen des Eventmanagements mit seinen Aufgabengebieten von der strategischen Planung bis zur operativen Durchführung und Steuerung ein. Zahlreiche ausgearbeitete Beispiele aus der Praxis und 66 Checklisten ermöglichen eine sichere Planung und Organisation. Die Autoren haben vielfältige Erfahrungen mit Projekt- und Veranstaltungsmanagement, Eventmanagement und Eventmarketing aus verschiedenen beruflichen Bereichen zusammengetragen und einen Leitfaden für alle erstellt, die ihre Veranstaltungen (noch) erfolgreicher machen wollen. In der zweiten Auflage wurde der Textteil aufgrund von Praxiserfahrungen und Rückmeldungen vielfach ergänzt und um folgende Themen erweitert: Eventkonzept, Informationsmanagement, Zugangskontrollsysteme, Versicherungen. Darüber hinaus wurden die neuesten gesetzlichen Bestimmungen berücksichtigt.",

    "description": "Trotz Börsenflaute ist Electronic Business ein Thema, das die wirtschaftliche Realität verändert hat und in Zukunft weiter verändern wird. In diesem Buch wird das Thema zunächst aus Sicht der betrieblichen Funktionsbereiche wie Einkauf, Produktion und Vertrieb behandelt. Anschließend erfolgt eine Betrachtung aus der Sicht der Querschnittsfunktionen der Unternehmungen wie z.B. Personal, Organisation, Rechnungswesen und Controlling. Auch das E-Business in öffentlichen Betrieben wird mit zwei Beiträgen vorgestellt. Ein letzter Beitrag beschäftigt sich mit den Aktivitäten im Bereich E-Business bzw. E-Commerce in Forschung und Lehre an einer Hochschule, wobei vor allem die Kooperationen mit Praxispartnern im Vordergrund stehen. Autoren des Buches sind Hochschullehrer und Praktiker.",
