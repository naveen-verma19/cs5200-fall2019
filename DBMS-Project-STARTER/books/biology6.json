    "description": "Here are some of the topics that are presented in The Vital Vastness - Volume Two: The Living Cosmos. The planets, though at first appear quite different, are actually very similar when noting a myriad of phenomena. All display a Field-dynamical structure similar to the Field-dynamical Earth Model (FEM) presented in Volume One. Star and planet formation, galaxies, galactic clusters and super clusters, and even, the large-scale structure of the Universe are also structurally similar with comparable phenomena. Some craters, and tektites, are the result of explosive ejection, not impact. The Tunguska event was one such event here on Earth. Unusual meteorites and animal falls are also the result of ejection. Our sun (as well as other stars) also displays the Field-dynamical structure of the other celestial objects. The planets, especially the Earth, do affect solar activity, but it is the result of an electromagnetic coupling, not the often suggested and discarded gravitational scenarios. The Sun, Moon and Earth are a single unit, as noted in a myriad of phenomena. Much, much more is also uncovered in this volume. Throughout both volumes the conclusions are clear, life has dominion over the Cosmos, and we need a new mind-set in our understanding and exploration of it. The most important direction for humanity is to understand that the care and nurturing - love - of life is of the utmost importance if we want a world filled with peace and plenty. The last book in the series, In Defense of Nature - The History Nobody Told You About, reveals the prehistory and history of human interaction with the Living Earth and Cosmos, disclosing the unrest and destabilization when we do not know of life's paramount importance.",

But exactly what (and why) we are trying to conserve remains a complicated and divisive question. This collection of essays features a diverse roster of internationally recognized experts who exemplify the wide range of views regarding how biodiversity should be defined--in terms of species numbers, categorization of landforms, different ecological levels, and as a dynamic and socio-political necessity for our own survival. In providing a synthesis of systematics and conservation, the book addresses problems such as matching species numbers, variety, and the systematic hierarchy assigned to geographic areas. In addition, the book outlines methods for selecting priority areas for conservation while challenging the concepts of \"megadiversity\" and \"hotspots\". Ecologists, taxonomists, conservation biologists, geographic information service managers, and those working for monitoring and land use organizations will want to read this book.",

    "description": "Life is the most extraordinary phenomenon in the known universe; but how does it work? Even in this age of cloning and synthetic biology, the remarkable truth remains: nobody has ever made anything living entirely out of dead material. Life remains the only way to make life. Are we missing a vital ingredient in its creation? Like Richard Dawkins' The Selfish Gene, which provided a new perspective on evolution, Life on the Edge alters our understanding of life's dynamics as Jim Al-Khalili and Johnjoe Macfadden reveal the hitherto missing ingredient to be quantum mechanics. Drawing on recent ground-breaking experiments around the world, they show how photosynthesis relies on subatomic particles existing in many places at once, while inside enzymes, those workhorses of life that make every molecule within our cells, particles vanish from one point in space and instantly materialize in another. Each chapter in Life on the Edge opens with an engaging example that illustrates one of lifeâe(tm)s puzzles âe\" How do migrating birds know where to go? How do we really smell the scent of a rose? How do our genes manage to copy themselves with such precision? âe\" and then reveals how quantum mechanics delivers its answer. Guiding the reader through the maze of rapidly unfolding discovery, Al-Khalili and McFadden communicate vividly the excitement of this explosive new field of quantum biology, with its potentially revolutionary applications, and also offer insights into the biggest puzzle of all: what is life?",

Eric Simon's Biology: The Core combines a succinct, beautifully illustrated 12-chapter textbook with engaging MasteringBiology assignment options and extensive instructor support materials. The Core delivers a uniquely flexible teaching and learning package that supports Active Learning or \"Flipped Classroom\" teaching techniques, and an emphasis on current issues that relate to basic biological concepts. The modular organization of the text makes it easy for instructors to teach concepts in their preferred order, and powerful online assignment options reinforce those concepts by clarifying the \"big picture\" and preparing your students with the biological literacy skills required to make informed decisions outside the classroom. The Second Edition text and MasteringBiology assignment options furtherrevolutionize teaching in and out of the classroom with a greater emphasis on the nature of science and dozens of new opportunities for students to practice basic science literacy skills. The Core's concise modules continue to focus students' attention on the most important concepts, combining dynamic figures and illustrations with supporting narrative as the primary source of instruction to create a more engaging and accessible learning experience for students. The new edition has been revised to strengthen the ways the text, MasteringBiology, and the instructor support materials work together in meeting the needs of both instructors and students-before, during, and after class. Also available with MasteringBiology (tm) MasteringBiology is an online homework, tutorial, and assessment product proven to improve results by helping students quickly master concepts. Students benefit from opportunities to practice basic science literacy skills, using interactive resources that create engaging learning experiences. Effective activities in MasteringBiology help students further visualize and understand complex biological processes. Comprehensive instructor tools include MasteringBiology assignment options.

    "publisher": "Oxford University Press",
    "publishedDate": "1996",
    "description": "R. M. Hare is well known both for his seminal work in ethical theory and for his applications of it to practical issues. For this volume he has selected the best of his writings on medical ethics and related topics. Its chief theoretical interest lies in its synthesis between utilitarian and Kantian ethics, which are shown to have the same practical consequences. The main practical thesis in the book is that we can harm possible people by preventing them from becoming actual people. This thesis, if understood and accepted, would radically alter the terms of the public debate about embryo experimentation and population policy, and (perhaps surprisingly) support a fairly liberal view on abortion. The book also features general introductions to medical and psychiatric ethics, and essays on the concept of healh, on the morality of experimentation on children, on health care policy, on free will, and on vegetarianism.",

    "description": "Asking and answering questions is the cornerstone of science yet formal training in understanding this key process is often overlooked. \"Asking Questions in Biology\" unpacks this crucial process of enquiry, from a biological perspective, at its various stages. It begins with an overview of scientific question-asking in general, before moving on to demonstrate how to derive hypotheses from unstructured observations. It then explains in the main sections of the book, how to use statistical tests as tools to analyse data and answer those questions before, finally, showing the best practice in presenting scientific reports. As such, it is an indispensable companion to all students of biology, but particularly those enrolled in courses concerning experimental design; data analysis; hypothesis testing; research methods; or any practical project work. The late Chris Barnard was Professor of Animal Behaviour at Nottingham University. Francis Gilbert is Associate Professor of Ecology at Nottingham University. Peter McGregor isa Reader in Applied Zoologyat Cornwall College. \"",

    "description": "Laser micromanipulation--implying perforation, cutting and welding of biological objects using. optical tweezers, as well as moving them just by using, forces generated by a laser microbeam--is becoming an increasingly popular technique for studying biological objects, especially automatedDNA sequencing. This book is an excellent introduction to the basics and primarily biological applications of optical trapping and laser microbeam techniques. The author, one of the pioneers of the microbeam technique, examines the field in depth, covering basic physical principles to applications in cell and molecular biology, and biomedicine. This book bridges the gap between physicists who understand the underlying principles of the method but are not aware of its numerous biological applications, and biologists who seek background information on the underlying principles.

    "description": "The concepts of form and function have traditionally been defined in terms of biology and then extended to other disciplines. Stephen T. Asma examines the various interpretations of form and function in science and philosophy, reflecting on the philosophical presuppositions underlying the work of Geoffroy, Cuvier, and Darwin, among others. In the Continental tradition of Canguilhem and Foucault, Asma's treatment of the historical form/function dispute analyzes the complex interactions among ideologies, metaphysical commitments, and research programs. This is a highly significant contribution to the history of science, the history of philosophy, and disputes within contemporary biology.",

    "description": "This volume in the Tertiary Level Biology series fills a gap in the taxonomic literature by providing a comprehensive survey of the arguments and techniques of systematics as they are applied today to all groups of organisms. It covers the principles of nomenclature and classification, the logic and practice of cladistics, and, in a series of chapters, considers the scope, application, benefits and drawbacks of a wide range of sources of phylogenetically informative character systems, from behaviour and morphology to DNA. There is an emphasis on modern aspects of the subject.",

    "description": "This is an introduction to the philosophy of biology. The book provides sophisticated and innovative coverage of the central topics and many of the latest developments in the field. Emphasizing connections between biological theories and other areas of philosophy, and carefully explaining both philosophical and biological terms, Peter Godfrey-Smith discusses the relation between philosophy and science; examines the role of laws, mechanistic explanation, and idealized models in biological theories; describes evolution by natural selection; and assesses attempts to extend Darwin's mechanism to explain changes in ideas, culture, and other phenomena. Further topics include functions and teleology, individuality and organisms, species, the tree of life, and human nature. The book closes with detailed treatments of the evolution of cooperation, of information in biology, and of the role of communication in living systems at all scales.",

    "description": "Biology is a critical application area for engineering analysis and design, and students in engineering programs as well as ecologists and environmentalists must be well-versed in the fundamentals of biology as they relate to their field. Biology for Engineers, Second Edition is an introductory text that minimizes unnecessary memorization of connections and classifications and instead emphasizes concepts, technology, and the utilization of living things. Whether students are headed toward a bio-related engineering degree or one of the more traditional majors, biology is so important that all engineering students should know how living things work and act. Emphasizing the ever-present interactions between a biological unit and its physical, chemical, and biological environments, the book provides ample instruction on the basics of physics, chemistry, mathematics, and engineering through a systems approach. It brings together all the concepts one needs to understand the role of biology in modern technology. Classroom-tested at the University of Maryland, this comprehensive text introduces concepts and terminology needed to understand more advanced biology literature. Filled with practical detailed examples, the book presents: Presents scientific principles relevant to biology that all engineers, ecologists and environmentalists must know A discussion of biological responses from the perspective of a broad range of fields such as psychology, human factors, genetics, plant and animal physiology, imaging, control systems, actuary, and medicine Includes end of chapter questions to test comprehension Provides updated material to reflect the latest research developments such as CRISPR.

    "description": "What motivated the man behind the development of the birth control pill? What was the reaction from the Catholic Church? How did the introduction of oral contraception affect the lives of women around the world? For the first time, discover the remarkable story of Gregory Goodwin Pincus, the man who championed the research and development of the pill. Dr. Leon Speroff, himself a renown specialist in reproductive endocrinology, has written a comprehensive biography revealing the personal story behind this dedicated man. The author has interviewed Pincuss living relatives, and numerous others who knew the scientist personally. This book successfully balances the hype and emotional reaction to oral contraception with objective evidence of its value in the world. Thoroughly researched, this is a fascinating read.",

Now in its Second Edition, this user-friendly guide on biostatistics focuses on the proper use and interpretation of statistical methods. This textbook does not require extensive background in mathematics, making it user-friendly for all students in the public health sciences field. Instead of highlighting derivations of formulas, the authors provide rationales for the formulas, allowing students to grasp a better understanding of the link between biology and statistics. The material on life tables and survival analysis allows students to better understand the recent literature in the health field, particularly in the study of chronic disease treatment. Biostatistics now includes a companion website to demonstrate the different applications of computer packages for performing the various analyses presented in this text. * Includes access to a companion website with further examples and a full explanation of computer packages * Over 40% new material with modern real-life examples, exercises and references * New chapters on Logistic Regression; Analysis of Survey Data; and Study Designs * Introduces strategies for analyzing complex sample survey data * Written in a conversational style more accessible to students with real data",

    "description": "Get the most realistic practice available for the MCAT's Biological and Biochemical Foundations of Living Systems Section. Next Step's Strategy and Practice books give you a focused review of several different approaches to MCAT problems, and then offer the single most important resource an MCAT student needs: full timed section practice. Test your skills by completing practice sections and then build upon them with the most thorough explanations available in any MCAT prep book. Unlike most other books (that simply give you an answer key and maybe a short description of the right answer), all of Next Step's Strategy and Practice books show you how to do a thorough breakdown of the passage itself and then follow that up with a careful analysis of the question and every answer choice. Those who purchase a Next Step book also get free access to our online MCAT diagnostic test. See the URL at the front of the book for instructions on how to register. Finally, you can always check for free updates and free upgrades to our books here: http://nextsteptestprep.com/mcat-materials-change-log/Important Note: Due to a printing error with one of our books, we temporarily removed our books from Amazon so we could do a thorough review of all materials. If you purchased this (or any!) Next Step MCAT book prior to 2/1/2015, we will offer a free upgrade replacement book. Just email us at mcat@nextsteptestprep.com with a copy of your receipt.
