    "description": "In the early 1960s, an anonymous committee of ordinary citizens in Seattle debated over which kidney disease victims to choose for an experiment with something new: a kidney dialysis machine. If the experiment worked, a small number of people would live instead of surely die from kidney failure. But who among the selection pool lives? How will the committee choose? Based on that premise and creating his own committee, playwright Christopher Meeks centers the action on one person, attorney Gabriel Hornstein, who desperately needs what the committee offers. In a review of the play in Los Angeles, the LA Weekly wrote, \"Christopher Meeks takes this factual scenario and transforms it into a thought-provoking drama, which relates a timely story about both ethics and morals.... Meeks' script is smartly written.\"",

    "description": "'That evening more firmly than ever fastened into my soul the conviction that Fate was of stone, and Hope a false idol - blind, bloodless, and of granite core. I felt, too, that the trial God had appointed me was gaining its climax, and must now be turned by my own hands, hot, feeble, trembling as they were' With neither friends nor family, Lucy Snowe sets sail from England to find employment in a girls' boarding school in the small town of Villette. There she struggles to retain her self-possession in the face of unruly pupils, an initially suspicious headmaster and her own complex feelings, first for the school's English doctor and then for the dictatorial professor Paul Emmanuel. Drawing on her own deeply unhappy experiences as a governess in Brussels, Charlotte Brontë's last and most autobiographical novel is a powerfully moving study of isolation and the pain of unrequited love, narrated by a heroine determined to preserve an independent spirit in the face of adverse circumstances. The Penguin English Library - 100 editions of the best fiction in English, from the eighteenth century and the very first novels to the beginning of the First World War.",

    "description": "In the high desert town of Frenchman’s Bluff, Idaho, Felicia Kristoffersen has set out to create a future for herself that is better than her painful past. Alone in the world with only her faith to sustain her, she must prove herself as this tiny community’s new school teacher. She cannot, must not, fail. But, there are those who never wanted her there to begin with. Five years after the death of his wife, local merchant Colin Murphy cares about just one thing: raising his daughter, Charity. Colin wants to give her the educational advantages he never had. The new schoolmarm’s inexperience doesn’t sit well with him, and if this teacher up and marries like the last one did, Charity’s heart will be broken once again. A woman who hasn’t known love. A man who lost the love he had. In the midst of the wide, sage-covered plains, each is about to discover that life’s bitterest circumstances truly can work together for good. Tender, evocative, and beautifully written, Belonging is a journey about love after loss, and about two hearts destined to become one—despite their stubbornness! Belonging is Robin Lee Hatcher at her best! —Tamera Alexander, bestselling author of Within My Heart and The Inheritance Belonging is vintage Robin Lee Hatcher: a touching, tender love story, filled with genuine conflict and characters that quietly build a nest in your heart. A skillful blend of description, emotion, and spiritual reflection, Belonging will sweep you away to late nineteenth-century Idaho, glad to have a seasoned novelist driving your buckboard wagon with a sure hand. By story's end you'll no doubt sigh with relief, smile with delight, and turn back to page one for a second visit with our determined Miss K. Loved it!\" — Liz Curtis Higgs, New York Times bestselling author of Mine Is the Night",

    "description": "In Regency England, a beautiful young woman finds her life thrown into turmoil by the arrival of a handsome scoundrel. Lady Elizabeth, the youngest and most headstrong of the three Banning sisters, has been engaged three times, and has most scandalously broken off all three engagements. Her fear of becoming any man’s property has kept her from marriage and earned her a reputation in the ton as a heartbreaking flirt. Neil Severin is a wicked rogue, black of heart and black of reputation. A man of no morals, devoid of compassion, he is a governmentsanctioned assassin. And his newest target is a man Beth holds dear. When the flame-haired beauty thwarts his plan, Neil exacts his own brand of spicy revenge. Beth despises him. Neil doesn’t care. But circumstances most unexpectedly throw them together, and with Beth’s life in danger, Neil finds himself in the unexpected role of hero, racing to save her before it’s too late. What he never expects is the twist fate hands him: instead of his saving her, Beth winds up saving him. When the ruthless organization he works for turns its agents loose on him, only Beth stands between him and a death he thought he didn’t fear. In a fight for their lives, Neil and Beth travel the British countryside, fleeing the ruthless killers out for Neil’s blood, the men after Beth, and their growing attraction to each other. Can Neil forgive himself for his past and accept Beth’s love? Can Beth overcome her fear and trust Neil? Will she have to choose between him and her family? And most important, can they both survive long enough to begin a new life together? The third in the Banning Sisters trilogy that began with the New York Times bestsellers Scandalous and Irresistible, Shameless marks a dazzling return to historical fiction for Karen Robards.",

    "description": "The heart knows no law in this sweeping historical western romance from the bestselling author of Comanche Sunset. After the brutal murder of their parents at the hands of American soldiers, Nina Juarez and her brother Emilio have learned to survive by any means necessary. Skilled with horses and not much else, the two make their name as outlaw wranglers. But Nina, weighed down with the guilt of their crimes and yearning to settle down, wants out of the business. After their next target, Nina’s headed for California or bust. When plans go awry, Nina finds herself at the mercy of an army officer on his last mission. She owed these gringos nothing, but now she owes the handsome Lieutenant Clay Youngblood her life. Clay, enchanted by his encounter with this Mexican beauty, does the unthinkable for a lawman—he lets her go free. Now Nina is caught between the law, her brother, and the only man capable of taming her heart. “A unique and wonderful story.” —Janelle Taylor, New York Times–bestselling author",

The story evolves while Europe is in the throes of the deepest Dark Ages, at a time when wild barbarian tribes freely roam the continent. Rosamond, a Gepid princess, finds herself swept in the maelstrom of clashing chieftains driven by an ancient hatred. She loses her family and her nation is destroyed. A cruel fate condemns her to marry her father’s assassin, Alboin, king of the Lombards, and she has to endure untold humiliations. Eventually, the tide of history takes her from the Hungarian steppes she loves to the heart of the old Roman Empire. Alboin’s hordes invade Italy and begin wrenching the country from the hands of the Byzantines. In the new land she tragically falls in love with Helmich, the king’s protégé, and dreams of happiness and freedom. Pushed on edge by one last hideous humiliation contrived by her husband, and after a rich series of intrigues, she makes the ultimate choice.",

    "description": "Wellington has always boasted a strong literary tradition, from its most famous daughter, Katherine Mansfield, to the richly talented young writers who have graduated from Victoria University's creative writing class in recent years. In this impressive collection of short stories, poetry and extracts from novels and memoirs, Kate Camp captures the character of a unique city. Her anthology encompasses excerpts from novels as diverse as those by Robin Hyde, Damien Wilkins and Noel Virtue, short stories by William Brandt, Patricia Grace and Samara McDowell, and a special appearance by Carmen. The city that emerges is a passionate and vibrant place. Wellington is 'like a beautiful, moody lover,' Kate Camp says in her introduction, 'at least you know you're alive.' The 'Our City' series offers a new perspective on New Zealand's major cities. Each volume presents a selection of the literature inspired by one of New Zealand's four major cities. Chosen with care by a well-known editor from each city, the selections include short stories, poems, and extracts from novels and writers' memoirs. Each contributor, whether contemporary or historical, has a strong association with the city concerned, and every selection has something significant to say about the character of the city. Together they create a vivid picture of what makes the city unique.",

At last, she admits she's tired of loneliness, of being closeted, and her column reflects her restlessness. Enter Princess Charming in the shapely form of gifted concert pianist Cory Chamberlain, and Helen embraces love once again. But when notables from Hollywood to Broadway give Helen their approval to perform in a star-studded, all lesbian and gay show, will Helen and Cory find happiness when one yearns to break out of the closet and breathe free, while the other fears that will destroy her career?",

    "description": "The stakes couldn't be higher: the destiny of the universe! Eddie, slacker extraordinaire, and his best friend, the permanently 'resting' actor Justin, have never really bothered with life's big questions. They are too busy down the pub quaffing pints. But when they visit their mate in a small town in the north of England, ready to have yet another bloody good time, things take a surprising turn. Two oddly familiar celestial beings, Alf and Ome, make Eddie the focus of a game to decide the supremacy of good or evil, once and for all. However, when they fail to play by their own rules, all out war is declared and Eddie and Justin are transported to the ethereal world of Alf and Ome, where Eddie uncovers their hidden truth and the tables are turned. Over the course of a weekend, the two friends, buffeted by supernatural forces, inadvertently trigger a plague and a major police operation against porn movie production. They revitalize an elderly couple's sex life, cause a police constable to eject a marigold glove from his rectum and another officer to release 50,000 volts from a Taser gun into a suspect's meat and two veg, as well as send a woman with Tourette's on an hallucinogenic mushroom trip. Oh, and witness the waters of the local levy parting and the creation of a new universe. This bawdy tale-in true -Chaucerian tradition-weaves multiple subplots around the key characters' encounter with the forces of good and evil. TRIP climaxes in an out-of-this-world confrontation between Eddie and Justin and Alf and Ome that unlocks the secrets of creation philosophers, physicists, theologians and cooks have failed to do: How did we get here, where do we go after we die and the recipe for Coq O'Noodle Do? \"The most offensive book I have read, very, very funny!\" \"an enjoyable mix of Ray Cooney and Tom Sharpe\" \"My fellow commuters stared at me when I cracked up reading the bit where the glove re-enters the world\" \"brilliant, very inventive and funny, very English\"",

    "description": "A pool—sink-hole, really—in small town Nebraska. It’s either a blessing or a curse, depending on the heart of the person who explores it. Ex-con Clarence and germaphobe Noell, are both being drawn to the pool. Clarence finds a yellowed newspaper article about it, stuck in his old law textbook. Noell stumbles across journals, documenting pool drownings back in 1937, in her vintage camper. Both dive in—or rather, Clarence falls in. Neither bargain for what they find. Rescued is the second book in The Great Escapee Series. Buy Rescued to continue Clarence’s story!",

A digital read-out ticking down toward certain death--and a fate more horrible still... For Alan Rockaway, his teenaged son Jeff, and Alan's new bride, Jenny, it's been little more than a fascinating tourist submarine excursion, a leisurely end to a weeklong church-couples' cruise. Then the horrifying crash and the plunge toward the unknown.... Everything Alan has assumed about himself, about what awaits him in the future, is flipped upside down. In the ultimate rescue operation, life or death is just the beginning!",

    "description": "When First Sergeant Dirk Kahane retires in 1855 after serving thirty years in the Marines, he doesn't have plans for the next phase of his life. Although he's relieved that he's finished chasing down illegal slave trading ships, Kahane knows that he must provide for his wife, Janine, and their children, fourteen-year-old Babs and thirteen-year-old Edgar.The answer arrives in the mail. Kahane learns that his uncle has died, leaving him the heir to a cotton plantation in Charleston, South Carolina. Looking forward to a challenge, Kahane and his family leave their home in Chester, Pennsylvania, and embark on new chapter in their lives.But life on the Spanish Oaks Plantation in South Carolina differs greatly from their former home in the North, and the family has a lot to learn not only about the cotton industry but about their slaves as well. Maintaining his strong faith and convictions, Kahane uses his skills learned in the military to overcome the challenges, and, in turn, improve the lives of others.",

Patrick O'Hanrahan, a Union soldier, lies wounded, surrounded by his dead and dying comrades. With more than two years of war ahead of him, Patrick doesn't know if his life will last even two more minutes. He also doesn't see the moral conflict he will eventually be forced to deal with after meeting Lou Ann Sommers, though he still plans to marry his hometown sweetheart, Beth Wheeler. Before the war is over, his encounter with Nathan, a slave, will profoundly affect his understanding of the cause for which he fights. And Patrick is stunned when he comes face-to-face in battle with his boyhood friend, Joshua Halperin, a Confederate captain, in a farmer's wheat field near Gettysburg, Pennsylvania. One Nation Under God illuminates the war's bloody contests through the eyes of four young people, traumatized by the fracturing impact of the Civil War. As they struggle to survive violence and upheaval, compounded by fear, suspicion, loneliness, and lost love, their hearts and minds become entwined and forever changed. Their courage to stand for their beliefs and risk everything reflects the nobility of our forefathers, who forever reshaped our great United States of America.",

But when she's paired with Special Forces Captain Jeff Steiger, she faces new danger. Steiger is all-American, from his blue eyes to his sun-streaked hair, and his laid-back manner goes against Kat's control-freak ways. When the two hunt for a high-end art thief, their opposite styles combust. And as mysterious commandos turn the job deadly, Kat must ditch her steely discipline and surrender to the desire that threatens to take them both down .",

    "description": "This first Earthseed novel by ground-breaking writer Octavia E. Butler feel like a prophetic nod to our current world. If you were glued to The Handmaid's Tale, you'll love this beautiful new edition of a seminal American classic. 'If there is one thing scarier than a dystopian novel about the future, it's one written in the past that has already begun to come true. This is what makes Parable of the Sower even more impressive than it was when first published' Gloria Steinem We are coming apart. We're a rope, breaking, a single strand at a time. America is a place of chaos, where violence rules and only the rich and powerful are safe. Lauren Olamina, a young woman with the extraordinary power to feel the pain of others as her own, records everything she sees of this broken world in her journal. Then, one terrible night, everything alters beyond recognition, and Lauren must make her voice heard for the sake of those she loves. Soon, her vision becomes reality and her dreams of a better way to live gain the power to change humanity forever. All that you touch, You Change. All that you Change, Changes you. What readers are saying about Octavia Butler: 'Kindred was written in 1979 but could have been written last year. Incredible. I couldn't put it down' 'Emotionally and viscerally alive and challenging. I don't know how I missed it before now' 'A masterpiece by a matchless artist. Butler is simply sublime' 'Reading these books will change your life' 'A finely crafted work, rife with emotional power, horrifying in its believability, with a message that cannot be ignored'",

    "description": "When the world's most innovative computer chess software is stolen, wisecracking, jazz bass-playing PI August Riordan is hired to find it. Sifting through a San Francisco peopled with bruising, ex-NFL henchmen, transvestite techno geeks, and alluring, drug-addicted dominatrices, Riordan has got his work cut out for him. But with a smart-ass attitude like Riordan's, nothing is easy ... A darkly comic sojourn through a town unrecognizable from the Tony Bennett song and the Rice-a-Roni ads, The Immortal Game is a Shamus, Barry, and Independent Publisher (IPPY) award nominee.",
