    "publisher": "Sage Publications Ltd",

    "description": "Being technologically competent is a badge of masculinity, while the ideal of femininity involves being 'hopeless with machines'. These are stereotypes however: What really happens? In this innovative book, which combines text and photographs, Cynthia Cockburn and Susan Ormrod demonstrate that the making of gender and technology are comparable social processes, one helping to shape the other. To illustrate their argument the authors take as an example the microwave oven - a recent innovation in domestic technology that neatly encapsulates the technology//gender relation. In the world of the microwave, masculine engineering encounters an age-old woman's technology: cooking. The authors follow the microwave's life trajectory from the design office to the factory and thence to the shops and the household. Examining the different jobs men and women do, the different kinds of knowledge they contribute and the unequal importance they are ascribed in the evolution of the microwave, this book shows how technology relations continue to disadvantage women. We see how the microwave begins as a state-of-the-art masculine technology, is translated in the retail trade into a 'family' commodity, one of a range of domestic white goods, and eventually settles into the kitchen alongside other humble feminine appliances. Unlike the old cooker, however, the microwave retains just a whiff of aftershave! Gender and Technology in the Making breaks new ground by building theory out of meticulous observation of lived relations - both comic and painful - between real men and women and the machines they make and sell, buy and use. It will be essential reading in the fields of sociology, technology studies and women's studies.",

    "description": "Timely, authoritative, application-oriented. an in-depth exploration of current and future uses of FPGAs in digital systems The development of field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) may well be the most important breakthrough for the microelectronics industry since the invention of the microprocessor. Using FPGAs, a system designer working on a PC can now develop a working prototype in a few hours and change it at will in just a few minutes, rather than waiting weeks or months for a printed-circuit assembly or a custom integrated circuit to be built. This newfound ability to change a system by simply altering its configuration memory is also leading to exciting new forms of computing, such as array applications that exploit parallelism. Now in a book that functions equally well as a working professional reference and a pedagogically consistent computer engineering text, John V. Oldfield and Richard C. Dorf: * Provide a detailed overview of FPGAs in digital systems design * Explain the underlying principles, strengths, and limitations of most FPGA architectures * Supply many real-life case studies, from elementary to advanced applications--including examples of \"custom computing machines\" * Review cutting-edge developments, including new architectures and a new field-programmable interconnect chip * Discuss key economic and business aspects of FPGA manufacture and applications and their role in intellectual property protection * Demonstrate ways in which FPGAs offer plausible solutions to some of the major computing problems of our day",

There are a number of good books on general radar systems: Skolnik and Nathanson are the most popular. There are also good monographs on advanced and specialty topics like synthetic aperture imaging. But there is a large, practical gap between the qualitative system books and the advanced DSP titles, and that is the slot this book fills.",

The mathematical model with significant impact on the control strategy is discussed as well as a kinematic control for underwater manipulation, dynamic control, and several motion control schemes. Experimental results on motion control and fault tolerance to thrusters faults with the autonomous vehicle ODIN are presented. The interaction with the environment is discussed and a simulation tool for multi-body-systems is presented. This software package, developed to test the presented control strategies, has been designed according to modular requirements that make it possible to generate robotic systems in the desired environment.\"--BOOK JACKET.Title Summary field provided by Blackwell North America, Inc.

    "description": "Become a more effective decision-maker, communicator, and manager by using the valuable techniques described in this unique book. It's designed to help you break away from the constraints of the technologist's \"analytical/scientific\" viewpoint and employ broader organizational and personal perspectives that strengthen your decision-making ability and leadership skills. \"Decision-Making for Technology Executives\" shows you how to utilize this multiple perspective approach to problem-solving and systems development in real-world, outside the laboratory, situations. You learn how this three-dimensional approach has been applied successfully to a wide spectrum of complex systems tasks: from system forecasting to technology assessment, from industrial catastrophes to facility siting decisions, from corporate strategy to acquisition. Through valuable case studies, such as the Exxon Valdez and Bhopal accidents, you learn lessons on improving technology and risk assessment, forecasting, and crisis management. And through ready-to-implement, practical guidelines you see how to become a more effective decision-maker and manager, while improving communication between technologists and others involved in the decision process. A one-of-its-kind look at the multiple perspective concept, this guide helps to increase your understanding of complex sociotechnical systems, boost the technologist's effectiveness as an executive, and improve technological risk management, forecasting, and planning.",

It covers a wide range of issues relevant to today's advanced RF integrated circuits and systems - the technology at the heart of wireless phones, pagers, home satellite networks, cable modems, and other revolutionary products. RF Microelectronics begins with a thorough introduction to the fundamental concepts of RF design, including nonlinearity, interference, and noise. It then moves to the system level, introducing modulation and multiple access techniques and reviewing current wireless standards such as CDMA, TDMA, AMPS, and GSM. Next, the book describes transceiver architectures, emphasizing their advantages and drawbacks with respect to monolithic integration and presenting case studies for each.",

    "description": "This highly topical book is a concise and accessible account of the relationship between technology and work. Firstly, it reviews and critically assesses a variety of recent approaches to the social and cultural dimensions of technology. Secondly, it examines the implications of these new approaches for existing ideas about the nature of technology and work organization. At the core of much thinking about technology is the assumption that the technical character and capacity of artefacts is given. The enduring image of deus ex machina captures the idea that it is the essential capacity 'within' a technology which, in the end, accounts for the way we organize ourselves, our work and other life experiences. Recent work in the sociology of technology, by contrast, sets out relativist and constructivist accounts of technology, which begin to challenge this central assumption. The Machine at Work includes a reinterpretation of the Luddites; a review of the social processes of development in information technology; a reassessment of theories of the role of technology in work; and an analysis of the common limitations of some constructivist and feminist perspectives on technology. The book argues that only a commitment to a particular conception of constructivism enables the kind of radical rethinking about technology and work relations that is needed. This engaging and informative text will be of interest to students in a range of subject areas - from sociology, organizational theory and behaviour, to industrial relations, management and business studies.",

    "description": "This is the first systematic attempt to survey in detail the archaeological evidence for the crafts and craftsmanship of the Sumerians, Babylonians, and Assyrians in Ancient Mesopotamia, covering the period c.8000-300 BC. As creators of some of the earliest farming and urban communities known to us, these people were among the first pioneers of many crafts and skills that remain fundamental to modern ways of life. Many of the raw materials for crafts had to be imported from outside the river valley of the Tigris and Euphrates, providing an unusually sensitive indicator of the commercial and cultural contacts of Mesopotamia. In this book Dr Moorey reviews briefly the textual evidence, and then goes on to examine in detail the material evidence for a wide range of crafts using stones, both common and ornamental, animal products - from hippopotamus ivory to ostrich egg-shells - ceramics, glazed materials and glass, metals, and building materials. With a comprehensive bibliography, this will be a key work of reference for archaeologists and those interested in the early history of crafts and technology, as well as for specialist historians of the ancient near east.",

    "description": "This is the original screenplay of Westworld as it was just two days before actual shooting began. Before this, there had been many cuts, changes, additions and deletions over a period of months. Much can be learned about actual film making from reading this book. It is to be suggested to read the Forward by Former Story Editor Saul David and the introduction by Michael Chrichton at least twice, once before downloading and seeing the original film and then afterwards. Now it is said Westworld was ahead of its time in depicting the dangers of computers and automated systems. Now we can realize that when the ro I am not sure that the author Michael Chrichton even realized what he had done here. He says that his goal was merely to provide \"entertainment.\" We now understand that the robots in the movie are breaking down because of a virus or a bug in the system. The guests are paying and coming to Westworld to experience life as it was in the days of Pompeii before it was destroyed in the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 79 AD, or the Medieval World of the 13th Century or the Wild West of the 1880s. Now we know the robots start breaking down or malfunctioning that they are being hit with a programming bug or by a computer virus. In this and many other respects this movie used new technology and did things that had never been been done before. The Medieval Queen who is a robot convinces the knight to fight a battle to the death with the Black Knight. She tells the knight he will win the battle because the Black Knight cannot see well from his left eye. It is a trap. The left eye has been repaired by the Technicians. So, the knight thinking he is sure to win is killed in real life by the Black Knight.",

    "description": "Mastering the Art of Technical Leadership As a dedicated leader, you've probably read everything you could on leadership. Many books have been written about it. But you're a technical leader, so it's guaranteed that much of what you've read is incomplete at best, and quite possibly inappropriate. Sure, you can learn a lot by studying ancient generals, sales gurus, or even Steve Jobs, but you've got to remember that Attila the Hun never deployed SAP. The Geek Leader's Handbook recognizes and respects the unique challenges that geek leaders face. It provides both practical advice and a framework rooted in the understanding that: Geeks are different. Geeks would rather lead technology than people, but only people can be led. Geeks have a hard time working with non-geeks, but those who learn to do it well become great geek leaders. The Geek Leader's Handbook gives you practical, immediately applicable advice tailored to the day-to-day challenges of technical leadership. You don't need yet another laundry list of things you should do. To really grow as a leader, you need a solid framework to understand why these approaches make sense and to empower you to adapt them to your environment. The book also takes an unflinching look at what makes geeks different from other folk. To uncover those differences, co-authors Paul Glen and Maria McManus, collaborated as geek and non-geek. By synthesizing both perspectives, they reveal surprising and liberating insights that will help geeks become great leaders.",

The thesis that technology has indeed become autonomous is contrasted with the position that, by its very nature, technology can only exist under human control. Thirty-four insightful essays are divided into eight parts, each with its own introduction summarizing the chapters and placing them in their appropriate contexts.",

    "description": "What happens when advances in technology allow many things to be produced for more or less nothing? And what happens when those things are then made available to the consumer for free? In his groundbreaking new book, The Long Tail author Chris Anderson considers a brave new world where the old economic certainties are being undermined by a growing flood of free goods - newspapers, DVDs, T shirts, phones, even holiday flights. He explains why this has become possible - why new technologies, particularly the Internet, have caused production and distribution costs in many sectors to plummet to an extent unthinkable even a decade ago. He shows how the flexibility provided by the online world allows producers to trade ever more creatively, offering items for free to make real or perceived gains elsewhere. He pinpoints the winners and the losers in the Free universe. And he demonstrates the ways in which, as an increasing number of things become available for free, our decisions to make use of them will be determined by two resources far more valuable than money: the popular reputation of what is on offer and the time we have available for it. In the future, he argues, when we talk of the 'money economy' we will talk of the 'reputation economy' and the 'time economy' in the same breath, and our world will never be the same again.",

    "description": "'This volume represents the latest thinking of the eminent group of scholars dedicated to our understanding of the \"social shaping of technology\". They have joined economic historians, evolutionary economists, and those doing studies of innovation, in enriching our understanding of the important yet subtle interactions between technology and society.' - Keith Pavitt, SPRU - Science and Technology Policy Research, University of Sussex, UK This book makes significant advances in analysing the relationship between technology and society. It highlights both the policy implications of this relationship and new possibilities for intervention by government, policymakers, managers and the public. Shaping Technology, Guiding Policy examines and utilises a variety of recently emerging concepts which highlight the scope for local discretion and choice in the way that technologies are designed and used as well as the broader structures and systems that may serve to restrict choice. By applying these concepts to an analysis of case studies of various social and technical settings, the book explores their utility for understanding the ways in which contemporary technologies are developed and applied and how they are made to influence society.",

In this age of capitalism run rampant, however, the corporations are focused solely on profit and dissuade us in every way possible from considering the long term implications of the technologies being developed. In the spirit of the child who pointed out that the emperor had no clothes, Lynn Hershman Leeson has bravely assembled a remarkable collection of writings which begs us to STOP and ask BIG QUESTIONS about the digital culture being born\" -Bob Stein, President The Voyager Company.",
