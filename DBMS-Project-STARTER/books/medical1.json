    "description": "'This is a fascinating book, by a leading researcher, covering one of the most exciting areas of modern nutritional research - how what we eat impacts our gut and brain. The combination of personal stories and cutting edge science is a real winner.' Michael Mosley You feel how you eat. We accept that the quality of our diet affects the health of our heart and liver. So why wouldn't diet - good or bad - affect the health of our brain? This is the question that Australian scientist Felice Jacka set out to answer. Having suffered depression and anxiety as a young woman, she wanted to understand the role diet plays in our overall mental and brain health. What she found through her own research and that of other eminent scientists worldwide will revolutionise the way we think about what we eat and how we care for our brains. * Obesity and depression are two major causes of disease and disability across the globe, and each influences the other. *Food does affect mood: highly processed foods increase depression risk, while a balanced, whole-food diet can prevent depression and improve mood. *A healthy diet improves gut health, and in turn health microbiota (gut bacteria) promote brain health and keep our weight in check. *A healthy diet improves brain performance at all ages, from school-age kids to their work-stressed parents. *The Mediterranean diet is linked to lower rates of Alzheimer's disease and general cognitive decline in older people. Professor Jacka, who leads the field of Nutritional Psychiatry research globally, provides not just the most recent scientific evidence but also a range of simple, practical solutions for improving the way we eat on a daily basis, including meal plans and a range of delicious recipes. This is not a diet book. This is a guide to the good habits that will protect your most precious organ, improve your quality of life and optimise mental and brain health across your lifespan. PRAISE FOR BRAIN CHANGER 'Jacka is leading the way in providing evidence-based approaches that are rooted in cutting-edge science to transform how we think about mental health.' Professor John Cryan",

    "description": "The American Disease is a classic study of the development of drug laws in the United States. Supporting the theory that Americans' attitudes toward drugs have followed a cyclic pattern of tolerance and restraint, author David F. Musto examines the relationz between public outcry and the creation of prohibitive drug laws from the end of the Civil War up to the present. Originally published in 1973, and then in an expanded edition in 1987, this third edition contains a new chapter and preface that both address the renewed debate on policy and drug legislation from the end of the Reagan administration to the current Clinton administration. Here, Musto thoroughly investigates how our nation has dealt with such issues as the controversies over prevention programs and mandatory minimum sentencing, the catastrophe of the crack epidemic, the fear of a heroin revival, and the continued debate over the legalization of marijuana.",

    "description": "The cultural and medical history of dementia and Alzheimer's disease by a leading psychiatrist and bioethicist who urges us to turn our focus from cure to care. Despite being a physician and a bioethicist, Tia Powell wasn't prepared to address the challenges she faced when her grandmother, and then her mother, were diagnosed with dementia--not to mention confronting the hard truth that her own odds aren't great. In the U.S., 10,000 baby boomers turn 65 every day; by the time a person reaches 85, their chances of having dementia approach 50 percent. And the truth is, there is no cure, and none coming soon, despite the perpetual promises by pharmaceutical companies that they are just one more expensive study away from a pill. Dr. Powell's goal is to move the conversation away from an exclusive focus on cure to a genuine appreciation of care--what we can do for those who have dementia, and how to keep life meaningful and even joyful. Reimagining Dementia is a moving combination of medicine and memoir, peeling back the untold history of dementia, from the story of Solomon Fuller, a black doctor whose research at the turn of the twentieth century anticipated important aspects of what we know about dementia today, to what has been gained and lost with the recent bonanza of funding for Alzheimer's at the expense of other forms of the disease. In demystifying dementia, Dr. Powell helps us understand it with clearer eyes, from the point of view of both physician and caregiver. Ultimately, she wants us all to know that dementia is not only about loss--it's also about the preservation of dignity and hope.",

    "description": "The updated third edition of Advances in Sport Psychologyoffers a view of the latest research in the field of sport psychology. The text is written by 34 of the field's most prolific researchers and scholars, including Maureen Weiss, Shane Murphy, and Albert Carron. These contributors extend the boundaries that have defined the field and provide a clear direction for future research. This third edition has been completely revised to reflect the advances that have occurred in the field within the past several years. The text provides readers with a complete picture of current research and emerging topics in sport psychology while challenging researchers to examine the factors that keep this discipline growing. Advances in Sport Psychology, Third Edition, provides a fresh look at sport psychology with these features: -Four new chapters on qualitative research methods, achievement goal theories, self-confidence, and family and peer influences -Significant revisions of the second-edition chapters, along with more concise overviews of individual topics -An analysis and synthesis of the state of knowledge for each topic and a discussion of future research directions The text focuses on the most important and active areas of current research, which recognize the merging of individual and socioenvironmental factors in making sense of sport performance and behavior. Each chapter includes a definition of terms, an explanation of the chapter's scope, and an outline of the sections. The author then provides a review of the available research and theory on the chapter's main topic, analyzes the state of knowledge in the area, and devotes significant space to future research directions. The book is divided into four parts. Part Ioffers a comprehensive introduction to the field, including definitions, history, and research paradigms and methodologies. Part IIexplores individual characteristics that affect sport participants' behavior, including self-perceptions, attributional patterns and perceptions of control, motivational orientations, and achievement goal perspectives. Part IIIexplores socioenvironmental factors that affect sport participants' behaviors. Part IVdelves into the research and theory concerning intervention techniques used for enhancing performance and modifying athletes' behaviors, including imagery and mental rehearsal, attentional processes, goal setting, and flow and peak performance. Advances in Sport Psychology, Third Edition, offers a new and thorough understanding of where sport psychology has been, where it is now, and where it is headed. This text will help students prepare and conduct their own research, and it will be a great reference for professionals who want to stay on the cutting-edge of the field.",

    "description": "Intrigued as much by its complex nature as by its outsider status in traditional organic chemistry, the editors of The Organic Chemistry of Sugars compile a groundbreaking resource in carbohydrate chemistry that illustrates the ease at which sugars can be manipulated in a variety of organic reactions. Each chapter contains numerous examples demonstrating the methods and strategies that apply mainstream organic chemistry to the chemical modification of sugars. The book first describes the discovery, development, and impact of carbohydrates, followed by a discussion of protecting group strategies, glycosylation techniques, and oligosaccharide syntheses. Several chapters focus on reactions that convert sugars and carbohydrates to non-carbohydrate molecules including the substitution of sugar hydroxyl groups to new groups of synthetic or biological interest, cyclitols and carbasugars, as well as endocyclic heteroatom substitutions. Subsequent chapters demonstrate the use of sugars in chiral catalysis, their roles as convenient starting materials for complex syntheses involving multiple stereogenic centers, and syntheses for monosaccharides. The final chapters focus on new and emerging technologies, including approaches to combinatorial carbohydrate chemistry, the biological importance and chemical synthesis of glycopeptides, and the medicinally significant concept of glycomimetics. Presenting the organic chemistry of sugars as a solution to many complex synthetic challenges, The Organic Chemistry of Sugars provides a comprehensive treatment of the manipulation of sugars and their importance in mainstream organic chemistry. Daniel E. Levy, editor of the Drug Discovery Series, is the founder of DEL BioPharma, a consulting service for drug discovery programs. He also maintains a blog that explores organic chemistry.",

Engen maintains that this neglect belies the critical role that the sense plays in human adaptation to the environment through the monitoring of odors. He perceives odor perception as mainly psychological, unlike the traditional approach which sees the sense largely as an innate mechanism with a direct physiological basis. The research underlying this book is the most current in sensory cognition, reminding the reader of the importance of the sense of smell through the use of many examples--including odor memory, fragrance effects on behavior, odors and sexuality, mother-infant bonding, and air pollution.",

Major topics include the purification of water, the treatment of wastewater, food microbiology, sexually transmitted diseases, and the methods used to survey populations. A variety of learning tools, including historical perspectives, case studies, government internet databases, and explanatory figures help the student to understand the critical concepts of microbiology as they are applied to improve health and prevent disease across populations. Designed for students who have had a first course in general microbiology, this one-of-a-kind textbook is ideal for upper level undergraduates and graduates in public health and environmental health, as well as environmental engineering, hydrology, and civil engineering. The text is accompanied by a complete package of instructor resources including Instructor’s Manual, TestBank, and PowerPoint slides available at http://go.jblearning.com/burlage.",
