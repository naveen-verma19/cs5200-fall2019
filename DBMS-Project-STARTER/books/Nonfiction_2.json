And yet there has never been a book that clearly examines the science behind these important issues--until now. In Did You Just Eat That? food scientists Paul Dawson and Brian Sheldon take readers into the lab to show, for example, how they determine the amount of bacteria that gets transferred by sharing utensils or how many microbes live on restaurant menus. The authors list their materials and methods (in case you want to replicate the experiments), guide us through their results, and offer in-depth explanations of good hygiene and microbiology. Written with candid humor and richly illustrated, this fascinating book will reveal surprising answers to the most frequently debated--and also the weirdest--questions about food and germs, sure to satisfy anyone who has ever wondered: should I really eat that?",

    "description": "Summary With Redux in Action, you'll discover how to integrate Redux into your React application and development environment. With the insights you glean from the experience of authors Marc Garreau and Will Faurot, you'll be more than confident in your ability to solve your state management woes with Redux and focus on developing the apps you need! Foreword by Mark Erikson, Redux co-maintainer. Purchase of the print book includes a free eBook in PDF, Kindle, and ePub formats from Manning Publications. About the Technology With Redux, you manage the state of a web application in a single, simple object, practically eliminating most state-related bugs. Centralizing state with Redux makes it possible to quickly start saved user sessions, maintain a reliable state history, and smoothly transfer state between UIs. Plus, the Redux state container is fully programmable and integrates cleanly with React and other popular frameworks. About the Book Redux in Action is an accessible guide to effectively managing state in web applications. Built around common use cases, this practical book starts with a simple task-management application built in React. You'll use the app to learn the Redux workflow, handle asynchronous actions, and get your hands on the Redux developer tools. With each step, you'll discover more about Redux and the benefits of centralized state management. The book progresses to more-complex examples, including writing middleware for analytics, time travel debugging, and an overview of how Redux works with other frameworks such as Angular and Electron. What's Inside Using Redux in an existing React application Handling side effects with the redux-saga library Consuming APIs with asynchronous actions Unit testing a React and Redux application About the Reader For web developers comfortable with JavaScript and React. About the Author Marc Garreau has architected and executed half a dozen unique client-side applications using Redux. Will Faurot is a mentor for Redux developers of all skill levels. Table of Contents Introducing Redux Your first Redux application Debugging Redux applications Consuming an API Middleware Handling complex side effects Preparing data for components Structuring a Redux store Testing Redux applications Performance Structuring Redux code Redux beyond React",

    "description": "Illustrator and artist Oliver Jeffers gives readers an unprecedented and intimate window into his creative process, weaving his popular works with never-before-seen art and illustrations, alongside his personal story of how he came to art, his love of books, and his bookmaking, fashioned from his personal sketchbooks. This dynamic visual biography is Jeffers's personal chronicle of an artist who blends his love of creating stories with his love of art and his infectious charm, and is a must-have for art lovers and bibliophiles both young and old. Oliver Jeffers takes a dive into Oliver's own origin story, inspirations, art evolution, and passion for storytelling: from growing up loving art and creating stories as a young boy in Belfast, Ireland; to finding a huge audience for his loveable stories; to what led him to his enormously clever found painting; to his collaborations with U2, TED, Colette, and Apple, to his newest meditative dipped painting art events. Oliver Jeffers is a fresh canvas for his imagination, and includes a pass through his most popular work, never-before-published illustrations and art, and a look into his more personal world of sketchbooks and doodles. Oliver's own story, infused with the whimsy and joy his work is famous for, is must-have not only for current fans of Oliver Jeffers's picture books, but also new fans, art lovers, and bibliophiles both young and old.",

    "description": "Science has now proved that the legendary Wim Hof Method of breath control and cold-training can dramatically enhance energy levels, improve circulation, reduce stress, boost the immune system, strengthen the body and successfully combat many diseases. While Wim Hof himself has run marathons in -30 C in shorts, swum hundreds of meters under the ice, sat in a tank of ice for 90 minutes without his core temperature changing and boosted his metabolism by over 300%, The Way of The Iceman documents how anyone can use Wim's methods to transform their health and strength, quickly and safely. -After teaching specialized breathing techniques to SEALs for years, helping them focus, stay warm in the cold ocean and get centered in combat, I can attest to the authenticity and power of Wim Hof's methods. Wim Hof is providing a great service with his new book The Way of The Iceman by bringing breath training and simple, powerful health practices into mainstream consciousness.- --Mark Divine, US Navy SEAL (ret), Founder SEALFIT, Best selling author of Unbeatable Mind and Way of the SEAL \u202a -I am continuously searching for ways to expand my mind, body and spirit--Wim Hof and The Way of The Iceman have done just that! He shows us that human potential is limitless and we are ALL capable of anything we set our minds to.- \u202a--Lewis Howes, New York Times bestselling author of The School of Greatness -What fascinates me most about Wim Hof's method is the potential application for athletes...the science in this book shows that we can all amplify our recovery, maximize our pain tolerance, massively jack up energy levels and even learn to control inflammation...and it can be done without resorting to toxic drugs. In fact, the system outlined in this manual might just be the key to producing a generation of enhanced but drug-free athletes.- \u202a--Paul -Coach- Wade, author of Convict Conditioning -Inspiration inspires. What I like most about Wim and his book is how he taught me to trust my body, overcome fear and give me the best opportunity for success. He mixes personal experience and science--which becomes truly motivating. Wim provides the tools you need to master self-discipline, gain courage and live a vibrant life. He is Aquaman and Tony Robbins rolled into one. He is The Iceman!- --Jesse Itzler, author of Living With A SEAL -Homo sapiens is a species that is uniquely and tragically ill-adapted to our environment. Maladies ranging from heart disease to diabetes to autoimmune disorders are generated by the mismatch between the natural world we evolved to live in and the artificial realms in which we find ourselves today. Wim Hof's teachings show us how to recalibrate our bodies in a way that recognizes the extremes of our natural environment as teachers to be celebrated and consulted, rather than enemies to be insulated against. Wim's deepest insights resonate with our hunter-gatherer ancestors, who understood the wisdom of adapting to the natural world rather than trying to dominate and control it.- --Christopher Ryan, PhD., New York Times best-selling author of Sex at Dawn -We live in a chaotic modern world with daily assaults on our health from frenetic schedules, poor sleep, high stress, chronic disease, and infectious illness. Our brain and nervous system have been highjacked by this toxic environment, always on high alert with real consequences to our physical and mental health. With The Way of The Iceman, Wim Hof has given a profound gift to public health. The science is solid and the results actual and measureable. As you follow his remarkable life story it is readily apparent that this man is no charlatan or snake oil salesman. Through years of commitment and self-experimentation, Wim has empirically figured out how to exert significant control over the autonomic nervous system, a feat once thought impossible. His method has held up to scrutiny under the dispassionate lens of science, expanding our knowledge of what is possible with dedicated training in what is now known as the Wim Hof Method. Deceptively simple, and incredibly powerful, The Way of the Iceman gives you not only the scientific framework, but actionable steps you can implement to take back control over your high-jacked brain, increase resilience from illness, and start healing yourself from the inside out. The Wim Hof Method has become a cornerstone in my personal daily wellness plan, and as a public health physician, I cannot recommend it highly enough.- --Dr. Chris Hardy, D.O. MPH, CSCS, Public Health Physician, Integrative Medicine Specialist -The Way of The Iceman is one of only two books in my life that I have read cover to cover the first time I put my hands on it. What won me over was the simplicity of the explanations of diabetes, inflammation and the family of modern ills. Moreover, the discussion on diet, just a brief mention of 'Fast-Five, ' is the first time I actually understood not only how inflammation is such an issue, but a means to deal with it. This book is the missing link for most of us: the discussion of breathing is so simple, yet so doable; coaches and athletes will understand a newer and simpler means of recovery. Nothing in the book is over the top and we are talking about a guy who swims under ice. The method is so simple, yet so elegant. It's marvelous and I think you will apply the techniques immediately.- --Daniel John, author of Never Let Go -Wim Hof has learned to control his physiology in a way rarely seen in human history. This book takes his extraordinary techniques and simplifies them so you can optimize your health and wellness. I recommend you learn the unique methods Wim has mastered in order to add vitality to your body and life.- --Chad Waterbury, neurophysiologist, author The Muscle Revolution -I found The Way of The Iceman absolutely fascinating! Many of us are familiar with the numerous benefits of cold training, such as increased energy levels, better circulation and improved mood, but nothing on the subject has ever been presented of this magnitude before! The legend himself, Wim Hof, along with Koen De Jong, share not only a detailed account of Mr. Hof's lifetime achievements (such as running a marathon in the Arctic... in just a pair of shorts!), but also practical, actionable methods that anyone can employ. This book has everything from progressive cold submersion methods to breathing techniques. It delves into meditation and spirituality, but also presents the hard science to back it up. Any fan of physical culture or anybody curious about how far the human limits can be pushed needs to add this to their library.- --Danny Kavadlo, author of Strength Rules -Wim Hof's techniques healed my gut where nothing else would. And I tried everything. The Way of The Iceman should be required reading. The world is just beginning to realize the extraordinary gift we have in Wim Hof.- --Mark Joyner, founder of Simpleology -As someone who enjoys bare-chested, outdoor winter calisthenics workouts, Wim Hof's extreme cold weather feats immediately appealed to me. The Wim Hof Method is so simple that anyone can get started right away. And the results are so palpable that once you start, you'll almost certainly want to keep going.- --Al Kavadlo, author of Street Workout and Pushing The Limits! -Wim Hof first came across my radar a few years ago when I heard of a crazy Dutchman defying the laws of thermodynamics. How could a man submerge himself in freezing water for prolonged periods of time without hypothermia? How was it possible for his body temperature to stay the same during the process? This book is an enlightening look into the nervous system, and the amazing power of the mind. Don't mistake this for simple 'cold therapy' although that is a piece of the puzzle. This book will give you a front row seat to an education on the nervous system, and how one man and his disciples have learned to control it in a way that we previously thought was impossible. I found The Way of The Iceman fascinating.- --Max Shank, founder of Ultimate Athleticism and author of Master The Kettlebell When I read The Way of The Iceman I was struck with awe and hope! Wim has brought scientific evidence to what I personally believe and have been teaching my students for years about breathing, bioenergetics and our connection to the spirit world. By demystifying the religious Wim is helping to support a Truth in the New World; mainly that spirituality without science descends into superstition, and science without spirituality degrades humanity into the meaninglessness of materialism.- --Elliott Hulse -Wim Hof makes the seemingly mystical and extraordinary, ridiculously easy to access. Anyone who is willing to explore the latent powers of deep breathing and imagination will feast upon his unique story and his method of overpowering the unconquerable elements of nature.---Matt Furey, author of Combat Conditioning -What lies within this book is the key to accessing power whenever and wherever on demand. A tool to transcend consciousness and tap into the highest version of yourself. Never have I experienced anything that allowed me to instantly shift vibration and release such energy.---AJ Roberts, Fitness Hall of Fame and All-Time World Record Holder",

    "subtitle": "An Autobiography Through Letters",
    "authors": [
     "Freeman Dyson"
    ],
    "publishedDate": "2018",
    "description": "Having penned hundreds of letters to his family over four decades, Freeman Dyson has framed them with the reflections made by a man now in his nineties. While maintaining that \"the letters record the daily life of an ordinary scientist doing ordinary work,\" Dyson nonetheless has worked with many of the twentieth century's most renowned physicists, mathematicians, and intellectuals, so that Maker of Patterns presents not only his personal story but chronicles through firsthand accounts an exciting era of twentieth-century science. Though begun in the dark year of 1941 when Hitler's armies had already conquered much of Europe, Dyson's letters to his parents, written at Trinity College, Cambridge, often burst with the curiosity of a precocious seventeen-year-old. Pursuing mathematics and physics with a cast of legendary professors, Dyson thrived in Cambridge's intellectual ferment, working on, for example, the theory of partitions or reading about Kurt Gödel's hypotheses, while still finding time for billiards and mountain climbing. After graduating and serving with the Royal Air Force's Bomber Command operational research section, whose job it was \"to demolish German cities and kill as many German civilians as possible,\" Dyson visited a war-torn Germany, hoping through his experience to create a \"tolerably peaceful world.\" Juxtaposing descriptions of scientific breakthroughs with concerns for mankind's future, Dyson's postwar letters reflect the quandaries faced by an entire scientific generation that was dealing with the aftereffects of nuclear detonations and concentration camp killings. Arriving in America in 1947 to study with Cornell's Hans Bethe, Dyson continued to send weekly missives to England that were never technical but written with grace and candor, creating a portrait of a generation that was eager, as Einstein once stated, to solve \"deep mysteries that Nature intend[ed] to keep for herself.\" We meet, among others, scientists like Richard Feynman, who took Dyson across country on Route 66, Robert Oppenheimer, Eugene Wigner, Niels Bohr, James Watson, and a young Stephen Hawking; and we encounter intellectuals and leaders, among them Reinhold Niebuhr, George Kennan, Arthur C. Clarke, as well as Martin Luther King, Jr. The \"patterns of comparable beauty in the dance of electrons jumping around atoms\" invariably replicate themselves in this autobiography told through letters, one that combines accounts of wanton arms development with the not-inconsiderable demands of raising six children. As we once again attempt to guide society toward a more hopeful future, these letters, with their reenactment of what, at first, seems like a distant past, reveal invaluable truths about human nature.",

    "description": "Science journalist and lucid dreamer Alice Robb explores fresh, revelatory research to uncover why we dream and how we can improve our dream life. While on a research trip in Peru, science journalist Alice Robb became hooked on lucid dreaming. With practice, she mastered the uncanny phenomenon in which a sleeping person can realize that they're dreaming and even control the dreamed experience. Finding these forays both puzzling and exhilarating, Robb dug deeper into the science of dreams at an extremely opportune moment: just as researchers began to discover why dreams exist. They aren't just random events; they have clear purposes. In essence, we cannot learn without them, nor can we overcome psychic trauma. Robb draws on fresh and forgotten research, as well as her experience and that of other dream experts, to show why dreams are vital to our emotional and physical health. She explains how we can remember our dreams better--and why we should. She traces the intricate links between dreaming and creativity, and even offers advice on how we can relish the intense adventure of lucid dreaming for ourselves. Why We Dream is a clear-eyed, cutting-edge examination of the meaning and purpose of our nightly visions and a guide to changing our dream lives in order to make our waking lives richer, healthier, and happier.",

    "description": "Figuring explores the complexities of love and the human search for truth and meaning through the interconnected lives of several historical figures across four centuries - beginning with the astronomer Johannes Kepler, who discovered the laws of planetary motion, and ending with the marine biologist and author Rachel Carson, who catalysed the environmental movement. Stretching between these figures is a cast of artists, writers, and scientists - mostly women, mostly queer - whose public contribution has risen out of their unclassifiable and often heartbreaking private relationships to change the way we understand, experience and appreciate the universe. Among them are the astronomer Maria Mitchell, who paved the way for women in science; the sculptor Harriet Hosmer, who did the same in art; the journalist and literary critic Margaret Fuller, who sparked the feminist movement; and the poet Emily Dickinson. Emanating from these lives are larger questions about the measure of a good life and what it means to leave a lasting mark of betterment on an imperfect world: Are achievement and acclaim enough for happiness? Is genius? Is love? Weaving through the narrative is a set of peripheral figures - Ralph Waldo Emerson, Charles Darwin, Elizabeth Barrett Browning, Herman Melville, Frederick Douglass, Nathaniel Hawthorne and Walt Whitman - and a tapestry of themes spanning music, feminism, the history of science, the rise and decline of religion, and how the intersection of astronomy, poetry and Transcendentalist philosophy fomented the environmental movement.",

Getting a traditional book-publishing contract is difficult and time-consuming, so many people opt to self-publish. If youre new to publishing, the process can seem complex. Publishize details a cost-effective method to quickly self-publish a book. In Publishize, you will find information on all the ins and outs of print-on-demand printing (without the subsidy press stigma) and get an overview of the latest online book marketing methods. The information in Publishize will help you find the time to write a book and run your business at the same time; deal with the often misleading and confusing terms surrounding print-on-demand printing and \"self-publishing\" companies; devise a mouthwatering book title that \"hooks\" exactly the right readers; and understand layout and design issues, so you end up with a professional book. Publishize also includes online marketing information, such as the six key elements of a book Web site and an overview of the latest methods for marketing books on the Web. Publishize explains everything from social media marketing to podcasting and video book trailers. Unlike most publishing books, Publishize focuses on the publishing industry from the business owner's perspective. With a focus on earning more profits and smart outsourcing, this book is a hands-on guidebook for entrepreneurs who want to add a new revenue stream to their business.",

    "description": "Was Americas response to the 9/11 attacks at the root of todays instability and terror? Because of various factors, including climate change, ISIS, the war in Syria, the growing numbers of immigrants, and the growing strength of fascist parties in Europe, commentators have increasingly been pointing out that the chaos in the world today was sparked by the post-9/11 attacks on Afghanistan and Iraq. At the same time, there has also been much discussion of ways in which the Bush-Cheney administrations response to 9/11 has damaged America itself by stimulating Islamophobia and fascist sentiments, undermining key elements in its Constitution, moving towards a police state, and in general weakening its democracy. While the first two parts of this book discuss various ways in which 9/11 has ruined America and the world, the third part discusses a question that is generally avoided: Were the Bush-Cheney attacks on Afghanistan and Iraq really at the root of the ruination of America and the world in general, or did the original sin lie in 9/11 itself?",

Wise's Eating Tomorrow discovers how in country after country, agribusiness and its well-heeled philanthropic promoters have actually exacerbated food crises. Most of the world, Wise reveals, is fed by hundreds of millions of small-scale farmers, people with few resources and simple tools but a keen understanding of what and how to grow. These same farmers - who already grow more than 70 percent of the food eaten in developing countries - can show the way forward as climate rises and population increases.",

    "description": "How to Be a Craftivist is a manifesto for quiet activism- how to tackle issues not with shouting and aggression but with gentle protest, using the process of 'making' to engage thoughtfully in the issues we are about, to influence and effect change. Sarah Corbett - professional campaigner and founder of the Craftivist Collective - shares her journey from burnt-out activist, tired of marching, confrontation and demonizing opposition, towards a more respectful activism- using craft to contemplate global issues, provoke thought and start conversations rather than arguments; to engage, empower and encourage people on and offline to become part of change in the face of injustice, inequality and prejudice. Interwoven with Sarah's personal stories of causes fought are ideas and suggestions for every novice craftivist. From how to think about the medium itself, to looking at colour, fonts, size and message, here is inspiration for every detail of your creation. In today's world it's easy to feel helpless, but here is a book to initiate debates rather than shouting matches, to enable collaboration in place of confrontation. Gentleness can be a great strength, and quiet action can sometimes speak as powerfully amid the noise as the loudest voice. And if we want a world that is beautiful, kind and fair... shouldn't our activism be beautiful, kind and fair?",

    "description": "During his regular days in London, Kenneth Grahame sat behind a mahogany desk as Secretary of the Bank of England; on weekends he retired to the house in the country that he shared with his fanciful wife, Elspeth, and their fragile son, Alistair, and took lengthy walks along the Thames in Berkshire, \"tempted by the treasures of hedge and ditch; the rapt surprise of the first lords-and-ladies, the rustle of a field-mouse, the splash of a frog.\"The result of these pastoral wanderings was his masterful creation of The Wind in the Willows, the enduring classic of children's literature; a cautionary tale for adult readers; a warning of the fragility of the English countryside; and an expression of fear at threatened social changes that, in the aftermath of the World War I, became a reality. Like its remarkable author, the book balances maverick tendencies with conservatism. Kenneth Grahame was an Edwardian pantheist whose work has a timeless appeal, an escapist whose withdrawal from reality took the form of time travel into his own past.",

    "description": "America has long been criticized for refusing to give harbor to the Jews of Europe as Hitler and the Nazis closed in. Now a U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum scholar tells the extraordinary story of the War Refugee Board, President Franklin D. Roosevelt's little-known effort late in the war to save the Jews who remained. In January 1944, a young Treasury lawyer named John Pehle accompanied his boss to a meeting with the president. For more than a decade, the Jews of Germany had sought refuge in the United States and had been stymied by Congress's harsh immigration policy. Now the State Department was refusing to authorize relief funds Pehle wanted to use to help Jews escape Nazi territory. At the meeting, Pehle made his best case--and prevailed. Within days, FDR created the War Refugee Board, empowering it to rescue the victims of Nazi persecution, and put John Pehle in charge. Over the next twenty months, Pehle pulled together a team of D.C. pencil pushers, international relief workers, smugglers, diplomats, millionaires, and rabble-rousers to run operations across four continents and a dozen countries. Together, they tricked the Nazis, forged identity papers, maneuvered food and medicine into concentration camps, recruited spies, leaked news stories, laundered money, negotiated ransoms, and funneled millions of dollars into Europe. They bought weapons for the French Resistance and sliced red tape to allow Jewish refugees to escape to Palestine. Altogether, they saved tens of thousands of lives. For Rescue Board, U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum scholar Rebecca Erbelding undertook a decade of research and uncovered new archival materials to tell the dramatic unknown story of America's last-ditch effort to save the Jews of Europe.",

In How the Internet Happened, he chronicles the whole fascinating story for the first time, beginning in a dusty Illinois basement in 1993, when a group of college kids set off a once-in-an-epoch revolution with what would become the first \"dotcom.\" Depicting the lives of now-famous innovators like Netscape's Marc Andreessen and Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg, McCullough also reveals surprising quirks and unknown tales as he tracks both the technology and the culture around the internet's rise. Cinematic in detail and unprecedented in scope, the result both enlightens and informs as it draws back the curtain on the new rhythm of disruption and innovation the internet fostered, and helps to redefine an era that changed every part of our lives.",

Anyone who works out or competes at any level is bombarded with the latest recovery products and services: from drinks and shakes to compression sleeves, foam rollers, electrical muscle stimulators, and sleep trackers.In Good to Go, acclaimed FiveThirtyEight science writer Christie Aschwanden takes readers on an entertaining and enlightening tour through this strange world. She investigates whether drinking Gatorade or beer after training helps or hinders performance, she examines the latest trends among athletes--from NFL star Tom Brady's infrared pajamas to gymnast Simone Biles' pneumatic compression boots to swimmer Michael Phelps's \"cupping\" ritual--and she tests some of the most controversial methods herself, including cryochambers, floatation tanks, and infrared saunas.At a time when the latest recovery products and services promise so much, Good to Go seeks answers to the fundamental question: do any of them actually help the body recover and achieve peak performance?",

     "Douglas McWilliams"
    ],
    "publisher": "Duckworth Overlook",
    "publishedDate": "2018-08",
    "description": "In this accessible and thought-provoking book, leading UK economist Douglas McWilliams challenges the claims of Thomas Piketty's bestselling Capital, arguing that economic inequality is driven not by a conspiracy of the rich, but by changes in technology and globalisation. Paradoxically, they are increasing inequality even as they reduce worldwide poverty. How can these seemingly contradictory conditions exist in parallel? What ultimately drives the global distribution of wealth?Drawing on the latest research, McWilliams investigates why wealth persistently remains in the hands of the one percent, and provides a comprehensive thesis as to why no economic system has yet superseded capitalism despite the challenges of ever more uneven income distribution. He warns of the coming wave of technological transformation - the 'fourth industrial revolution' - which is set to create a scarcity of unskilled jobs and explains what governments can do to prepare for this. The Inequality Paradox is written for the general reader but professional economists/policymakers will discover a fresh and authoritative new voice entering the global discussion. It is essential reading for understanding the global economy and indispensable in preparing for the imminent economic challenges of our rapidly shifting world.",
