     "Karen Schoemer"
    ],
    "publisher": "Free Press",

    "description": "February 1964: The Beatles step onto the tarmac at JFK International Airport and turn the country on its head. It's the advent of rock and roll's uninterrupted reign, youthful rebellion, and overt teenage sex. It's also the deathblow for the pop music of another generation -- the songs of Pat Boone and Georgia Gibbs -- and all its perky, white-bread conformity. Not two years later, Karen Schoemer is born, and comes of age with rock and roll. While her parents might enjoy the new music, the cultural upheaval passes them by, and they cling to the promises made by the music they loved as teenagers, the sweet, innocent 1950s pop of Patti Page, Frankie Laine, and the like. But having courted and wed against a backdrop of ideals peddled by this music -- finding true love, living happily ever after -- Schoemer's parents, like so many people, are crushed by disappointment when love doesn't deliver what the songs promised. Fifties pop falls quickly off the charts; their marriage eventually falls apart. In Great Pretenders, a lively, provocative blend of memoir and music criticism, former Newsweek pop music critic Karen Schoemer tries to figure out what went so wrong, way back in the hazy past, for her parents' marriage and for the music of their youth. To find the answers, she embarks on a strange, lonely journey in search of some of the brightest stars of the 1950s. Schoemer's search started when, twenty years after her parents' divorce, the new Connie Francis box set appeared on her desk at Newsweek. Now a successful rock critic dispensing post-punk opinions to the hipoisie, she was about to toss aside this relic when she was struck by the cover image of Francis, which bore an uncanny resemblance to her own mother; on a whim, she played one of the CDs. For all their cloying, simplistic sentimentality, songs like \"Where the Boys Are\" had an undeniable power -- \"the sound of every teenage girl in every bedroom on every lonely Saturday going back a thousand years.\" It was the music of her parents' long-lost adolescence, and much to her surprise, it moved her. Thus Schoemer, arbiter of Gen X cool, found herself falling into the saccharine thrall of 1950s pop music, that pariah of the rock establishment. Even as her colleagues tried to steer her away from the terminally uncool genre, she tracked down seven former pop idols of the late 1950s and early 1960s: Connie Francis, Fabian, Pat Boone, Patti Page, Tommy Sands, Georgia Gibbs, and Frankie Laine. As she became privy to their inner lives and immersed herself in their music, Schoemer revised her own notions about the fifties at the same time that she explored her family's vexed dynamic. The result is a wonderful romp through an unappreciated chapter in music history and, more important, through her own past. Full of humor, insight, and unflinching honesty, Great Pretenders bucks the received wisdom, explores the intersections of our private lives and pop culture, and broadens our understanding of a crucial moment in our history.",

The content is arranged by type of research tool (e.g., encyclopedias, periodical indexes, discographies) and includes a general statement about the uses of each tool and an annotated bibliography that points out their purpose, scope, strengths, and weaknesses. Covering both print and electronic resources, the text does not attempt to be exhaustive but rather guides students to the major research tools in music. A companion Web site maintained by the author helps keep the material up to date. Intended primarily for music bibliography classes taken by almost all students entering graduate music programs, the text is also a useful supplement for any undergraduate or graduate class in music that requires students to do library research or write a research paper.",

Spanning six decades, this coffee-table history goes a little deeper than most. Ertegun's anecdotes are intermingled with those of his business associates and recording artists. Atlantic's roster includes Ray Charles, Clyde McPhatter, the Drifters, Big Joe Turner, John Coltrane, Sarah Vaughan, Mabel Mercer, Bobby Darin, Wilson Pickett, Aretha Franklin, Sam and Dave, Dusty Springfield, Led Zeppelin, Tori Amos and so on. There are nine essays by some of the most respected music journalists. Each nicely crystallizes the label's enormous contributions to R&B, jazz, rock 'n' roll, pop and soul.",

    "description": "Marcelo Adonay (1848-1928) was a major Philippine composer and church musician whose long and fruitful career stretched from the 1870s to the 1920s. As maestro de capilla of the San Agustin church in Intramuros, Manila, he presided over the musical establishment of the powerful Augustinian Order that required the performance of elaborate instrumental and choral works. The first of two volumes, this pioneering work includes five major essays on Adonay's life, his milieu, an inventory of his extant and missing works, and musical and formal analyses of his magnum opus, Pequena Misa Solemne sobre Motivos de la Missa Regia de Canto Gregoriano. The centerpiece of the book is a modern edition of eleven reconstructed scores of his sacred music for various orchestral, vocal, and choral combinations. It is hoped that this publication will bring about the resurgence of performance of Philippine music from the nineteenth century and usher in a new appreciation of the artistic richness of this period of Philippine national history.",

    "description": "(Music Pro Guide Books & DVDs). Recording Unhinged: Creative and Unconventional Music Recording Techniques is a dare a challenge for those who think recording music should be done a certain way. Sylvia Massy, engineer, mixer, and producer of such all-time great artists as Tool, Prince, Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers, R.E.M., Oingo Boingo, Johnny Cash, Red Hot Chili Peppers, and many more, invites you to put everything you've ever known or learned about recording aside and dive head-long into the unknown. You might just find the doors blown off your conception of how great music should be recorded. If you want to take your creativity and freedom to a brand new level, open your mind and hear the sermons that Sylvia Massy preaches! She lives in a world far outside the norm, working in ways that, though frightening to some, yield results that are emotionally powerful, incredibly personal, gut-wrenching, organic, and even (based on her iconic client list) extremely commercially successful. Recording Unhinged contains many full-color R. Crumb-style illustrations by Massy, herself! In addition to being an A-list engineer/producer, she is a gifted artist! Her illustrations depict real and imaginary sessions and recording situations so the images move beyond literal demonstrations into the root-level heart and soul of her passion for recording and music! Also, included are lists, recipes, schematics, quotes, and stories, plus Massy interviews countless industry icons who shake-it-up in the music world.",

    "description": "Once-in-a-generation memoir of a rock legend - the No. 1 SUNDAY TIMES bestseller. With the Rolling Stones, Keith Richards created the riffs, the lyrics and the songs that roused the world, and over four decades he lived the original rock and roll life: taking the chances he wanted, speaking his mind, and making it all work in a way that no one before him had ever done. Now, at last, the man himself tells us the story of life in the crossfire hurricane. And what a life. Listening obsessively to Chuck Berry and Muddy Waters records as a child in post-war Kent. Learning guitar and forming a band with Mick Jagger and Brian Jones. The Rolling Stones' first fame and success as a bad-boy band. The notorious Redlands drug bust and subsequent series of confrontations with a nervous establishment that led to his enduring image as outlaw and folk hero. Creating immortal riffs such as the ones in 'Jumping Jack Flash' and 'Street Fighting Man' and 'Honky Tonk Women'. Falling in love with Anita Pallenberg and the death of Brian Jones. Tax exile in France, wildfire tours of the US, 'Exile on Main Street' and 'Some Girls'. Ever increasing fame, isolation and addiction. Falling in love with Patti Hansen. Estrangement from Mick Jagger and subsequent reconciliation. Solo albums and performances with his band the Xpensive Winos. Marriage, family and the road that goes on for ever. In a voice that is uniquely and intimately his own, with the disarming honesty that has always been his trademark, Keith Richards brings us the essential life story of our times.",

    "description": "Bel canto singing was a historical phenomenon which embraced Italian opera of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. It required infinite variety of sound, in particular a lyrical ecstacy, a faultless technique to dispatch the vocal pyrotechnics demanded of it, and earned itself eloquent praise as `the singing which is heard within the soul'. Rodolfo Celletti, who has devoted his whole career to studying the voice from every historical, technical, and musical aspect, offers here a fascinating history of bel canto singing and the voice in operatic literature. He begins by discussing the links of bel canto with the operatic ideals of the baroque, and points out that the style was created as much by operatic composers and their librettists as by their executants, the singers. To this end he undertakes a review of Italian opera of the period, andtraces the development of the style in different composers and their works. There is a chapetr on Castrati - the voice par excellence of bel canto - and the art of singing in their day. The final chapter looks at the history of bel canto since Rossini, charting its death and resurrection.",

    "description": "A legendary record producer and performer takes readers on an alphabetical journey of insights into the music of the Beatles and individual reminiscences of John, Paul, George, and Ringo. Peter Asher met the Beatles in the spring of 1963, the start of a lifelong association with the band and its members. He had a front-row seat as they elevated pop music into an art form, and he was present at the creation of some of the most iconic music of our times. But Asher was also a talented musician in his own right, with a great ear for what was new and fresh. Once, when Paul McCartney wrote a song that John Lennon didn’t think was right for the Beatles, Asher asked if he could record it. “A World Without Love” became a global number-one hit for his duo, Peter and Gordon. A few years later Asher was asked by Paul McCartney to help start Apple Records and the first artist Asher discovered and signed up was a young American singer-songwriter named James Taylor. Before long he would be not only managing and producing Taylor but also (having left Apple and moved to Los Angeles) working with Linda Ronstadt, Neil Diamond, Robin Williams, Joni Mitchell and Cher, among others. In The Beatles from A to Zed, based upon twenty-six episodes of his current and highly popular radio show “From Me to You” on the Beatles Channel of SiriusXM, Peter Asher shares his memories and insights about the Fab Four, weaving his reflections into a whimsical alphabetical journey that focuses not only on songs whose titles start with each letter, but also on recurrent themes in the Beatles’ music, the instruments they played, the innovations they pioneered, the artists who influenced them, the key people in their lives, and the cultural events of the time.",

    "description": "An insider biography of the Black Crowes by drummer and cofounder Steve Gorman For over two decades, The Black Crowes topped the charts and reigned supreme over the radio waves, even as hair bands, grunge, and hip-hop threatened to dethrone them. With hits like \"Hard to Handle,\" \"She Talks to Angels,\" and \"Remedy,\" their massive success launched them to stardom in the early '90s, earning them a place among rock royalty. They were on the cover of Rolling Stone, MTV played their videos 24/7, and Generation X re-discovered the power of classic rock and blues by digging into multi-platinum classics like Shake Your Money Maker and The Southern Harmony and Musical Companion. But stardom can be fleeting. For the Black Crowes, success slowly dwindled as the band members got caught up in the rock star world and lost sight of their musical ambition. Despite the drinking, drugs, and incessant fighting between Chris and Rich Robinson--the angriest brothers in rock and roll, with all due respect to Oasis and the Kinks--the band continued to tour until 2013. On any given night, they could be the best band you ever saw. (Or the most combative.) Then, one last rift caused by Chris Robinson proved insurmountable for the band to survive. After that, the Black Crowes would fly no more. Founding member Steve Gorman was there for all of it--the coke and weed-fueled tours; the tumultuous recording sessions; the backstage hangs with legends like Robert Plant, Jimmy Page, and the Rolling Stones. As the band's drummer and voice of reason, he tried to keep the Black Crowes together musically--and in one piece emotionally. In his first-person history of the Black Crowes, Hard To Handle--the first ever account of this great American rock band's beginning, middle, and end--Gorman makes it clear just how impossible that job was. Fortunately, Gorman tells the tale with great insight, candor, and humor. They don't make bands like the Black Crowes anymore: crazy, brilliant, self-destructive, inspiring, and, ultimately, not built to last. But, man, what a ride it was while it lasted.",

The orientation is strongly stylistic, dealing mainly with the polyphony of the late Baroque period. Three aspects are stressed throughout: practical work in writing counterpoint, utilizing various textures, devices, and genre of the period; historical background, to establish the origins of different forms and justify the pedagogical method employed here; analysis of selections from music literature, often in voice-leading reductions. After an opening chapter that reviews some general features of the late Baroque period, there is a brief survey of melodic characteristics, and a study of procedures associated with two, three, and four voices.",

    "description": "Careless Love is the full, true, and mesmerizing story of Elvis Presley's last two decades, in the long-awaited second volume of Peter Guralnick's masterful two-part biography. Last Train to Memphis, the first part of Guralnick's two-volume life of Elvis Presley, was acclaimed by the New York Times as \"a triumph of biographical art.\" This concluding volume recounts the second half of Elvis' life in rich and previously unimagined detail, and confirms Guralnick's status as one of the great biographers of our time. Beginning with Presley's army service in Germany in 1958 and ending with his death in Memphis in 1977, Careless Love chronicles the unravelling of the dream that once shone so brightly, homing in on the complex playing-out of Elvis' relationship with his Machiavellian manager, Colonel Tom Parker. It's a breathtaking revelatory drama that for the first time places the events of a too-often mistold tale in a fresh, believable, and understandable context. Elvis' changes during these years form a tragic mystery that Careless Love unlocks for the first time. This is the quintessential American story, encompassing elements of race, class, wealth, sex, music, religion, and personal transformation. Written with grace, sensitivity, and passion, Careless Love is a unique contribution to our understanding of American popular culture and the nature of success, giving us true insight at last into one of the most misunderstood public figures of our times.",

    "description": "Alongside the death of Elvis Presley and the assassination of John Lennon, Kurt Cobain's suicide in 1994 ranks as one of the generational milestones of American life - an epochal event in both rock 'n' roll and youth culture. This book is the story of Kurt Cobain's life, from abject poverty to unbelievable wealth, power and fame. It traces the journey from his humble origins in Aberdeen to becoming lead singer of Nirvana, the most popular rock band in the world from 1991 to 1994, and the most influential band of this decade. The beautifully written text is complimented by 16 pages of photographs. Based on over one hundred interviews, Charles Cross allows us to understand Kurt Cobain's personality. This is an incredible tale of a strange, tortured and very talented man.",

    "description": "What links Lead Belly, Lonnie Donegan and Black Betty? Whose gravestone inspired Phil Spector's first hit? And for which song did Johnny Rotten replace the singer from Def Leppard? The rich history of popular music is built on a foundation of classic songs. From Tin Pan Alley to the Brill Building, Bob Dylan to Kurt Cobain, and Joni Mitchell to Amy Winehouse, gifted songwriters have crafted a cherished body of music that has become part of our lives. Imagine the Fifties without the magical clamor of \"Tutti Frutti\" and \"Hound Dog\" the Seventies without the anthemic \"Le Freak\" and \"Anarchy in the UK\" or the Noughties without the Leftfield pop of \"Toxic\" or \"Crazy\". This music mirrors the times, both reflecting society at large (\"A Change is Gonna Come\", \"The Message\") and mapping our own personal highs (\"God Only Knows\") or lows (\"Hurt\"). And from 'Saturday Night Fish Fry' to Saturday Night Fever, it has helped us simply forget our problems. 1001 Songs You Must Hear Before You Diepicks through nearly a century of music to bring you an inspiring selection of some of the greatest recordings ever made. Each entry in this wonderfully browsable book tells the story of a great song. Find out what inspired the songwriter, what makes the track so enduring, which songs it influenced in turn and which cover version to listen out for. You'll also pick up a wealth of fascinating trivia along the way.",

    "description": "Bret Michaels, lead vocalist of glam metal band Poison and star of VH1's hit reality show Rock of Love with Bret Michaels, is ready to write a provoking autobiographical account of his life similar in nature to Motley Crue's The Dirt. Bret Michaels is, if nothing else, a true survivor. He has survived a lifelong battle as an insulin dependent diabetic, a well publicized near fatal car crash in 1994 and the countless musical trends and fads of the last two decades. \"As soon as I ever start to just go through the motions I'll quit,\" confessed the 44 year old singer, songwriter, producer, director and actor in a recent interview. But there's little chance he'll even slow down let alone quit anytime soon. In fact, after more than 20 years in the business this award winning, multi platinum superstar's career continues to move at warp speed. As front man for the legendary rock band Poison, Michaels has sold 25 million records and scored an amazing 15 chartbusting Top 40 singles including the timeless #1 smash \"Every Rose Has its Thorn.\" More recently, on VH1's Rock of Love, twenty lucky ladies got their chance for an All-Access pass to Bret Michaels' heart and to share in all his superstar lifestyle. With 5.4 million viewers, it is the second most popular show on VH1 and has already been renewed for a second season. Roses & Thorns will cover all of Bret's rockstardom, including... The band: From the Pennsylvania creation of \"the ultimate garage band\" through MTV's banning of their explicit videos to their 2007 sold-out summer tour. The partying: Because he's diabetic, Bret never really did the dope and booze partying like the others, but he was at the center of this movement full of excess, and definitely has stories to tell. The fights: The conflict with C. C. Deville that culminated in a fistfight backstage at the 1991 MTV Video Music Awards, and the firing of Deville. The conflict with Bobby Dall that culminated at a show in Atlanta where Bret announced to the audience, \"You may have just seen the last concert by Poison in its current formation.\" The accident: Recording of Poison's sixth album was brought to a halt in May 1994 when Michaels was involved in a car accident where he suffered a broken nose, ribs, jaw, and fingers and lost four teeth. The sex tape: Michaels had a short but notorious relationship with Pamela Anderson. An explicit sex tape the couple made appeared on the internet was released as a DVD in 2005. The rebirth of a rockstar: Bret's solo career as a country artist, his stint as a judge on CMT's Nashville Star, making an appearance in Guitar Hero III, and his journey to find the woman who can rock his love life via VH1's Rock of Love with Bret Michaels and Rock of Love 2 with Bret Michaels which is currently airing.",

    "description": "There is a common misconception about KISS, one of the greatest hard-rock/heavy metal-bands of all-time: that their ‘non-makeup’ era of 1983-1996 is not as enduring as the period when they stalked stages as the Starchild, the Demon, the Spaceman, and the Cat. This is untrue. In fact, this period helped resuscitate KISS’s career, as they reestablished themselves in arenas, on the charts, and via MTV, and yielded some of their most popular songs – including Lick It Up, Heaven’s On Fire, Tears Are Falling, Crazy Crazy Nights, Hide Your Heart, Forever, Unholy, and more – many of which consistently found their way into the band’s set lists. While the majority of KISS books are focused on the glitz and glamour of the iconic makeup era, the non-makeup years are ripe to be explored in book form, and Take It Off does just that, zeroing in on the eleven albums KISS issued during this period – including such gold- and platinum-certified hits as Lick It Up, Animalize, Revenge, and Alive III – as well the resulting tours, videos, and other escapades. Take It Off draws on all-new interviews with KISS experts and associates, including the band’s lead guitarist throughout most of this period, Bruce Kulick, plus Crazy Nights producer Ron Nevison and video director Paul Rachman (Unholy/I Just Wanna/Domino). Among the other contributors are Charlie Benante (Anthrax), K.K. Downing (ex-Judas Priest), Derek Sherinan (ex-Dream Theater), and rock music experts Eddie Trunk, Katherine Turman, and Lonn Friend. The book also includes a foreword by Fozzy frontman Chris Jericho and an afterword by acclaimed producer Andreas Carlsson, as well as rare photographs and memorabilia from the period. With KISS currently in the midst of their last ever tour, now is the time to get Truly Unmasked.",

The foundational concept of this book—that the values of music are gained through direct experiences with its meaningful sounds—remains intact, but is explained and applied in broader, more inclusive scope, with a synergistic philosophical stance as the basis. In addition it clarifies and updates for readers the explanations of musical feeling, musical creativity, and musical meaning that are at its core. For music educators, music lovers, or anyone who wants a synergistic philosophy of music education inclusive of a variety of positions.",

Throughout it all, they shared a bond more intimate than any other in Prince's life. No one else can tell this story or can provide a deeper, more nuanced portrait of Prince--both the famously private man and the pioneering, beloved artist--than Mayte, his partner during some of the most pivotal personal and professional years of his career. The Most Beautiful is a book that will be returned to for decades, as Prince's music lives on with generations to come.",

    "description": "An intimate, revealing look at one artist’s journey from self-censorship to full expression As one of the most celebrated musicians of our time, Alicia Keys has enraptured the nation with her heartfelt lyrics, extraordinary vocal range, and soul-stirring piano compositions. Yet away from the spotlight, Alicia has grappled with private heartache—over the challenging and complex relationship with her father, the people-pleasing nature that characterized her early career, the loss of privacy surrounding her romantic relationships, and the oppressive expectations of female perfection. Since her rise to fame, Alicia’s public persona has belied a deep personal truth: she has spent years not fully recognizing or honoring her own worth. After withholding parts of herself for so long, she is at last exploring the questions that live at the heart of her story: Who am I, really? And once I discover that truth, how can I become brave enough to embrace it? More Myself is part autobiography, part narrative documentary. Alicia’s journey is revealed not only through her own candid recounting, but also through vivid recollections from those who have walked alongside her. The result is a 360-degree perspective on Alicia’s path—from her girlhood in Hell’s Kitchen and Harlem, to the process of self-discovery she’s still navigating. In More Myself, Alicia shares her quest for truth—about herself, her past, and her shift from sacrificing her spirit to celebrating her worth. With the raw honesty that epitomizes Alicia’s artistry, More Myself is at once a riveting account and a clarion call to readers: to define themselves in a world that rarely encourages a true and unique identity.",

And Taylor knows how to sin. As a small-town hero in the early '90s, he threw himself into a hard-drinking, fierce-loving, live-for-the-moment life; when his music exploded, he found himself rich, wanted, and on the road. But soon his extreme lifestyle led him to question what it means to sin and whether it could-or should-be cast in a different light. After all, if sin makes us human how wrong can it be?Now updated with a new Afterword by the author, Seven Deadly Sins is a brutally honest look \"at a life that could have gone horribly wrong at any turn,\" and the soul-searching and self-discovery it took to set it right.",
