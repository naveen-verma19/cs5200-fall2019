    "description": "WINNER OF THE 2007 BRITISH PSYCHOLOGICAL SOCIETY BOOK AWARD 2007 'It is noteworthy that after I used some of the illustrations and mentioned the book in class, most students went and bought a copy. Their final papers were heavily \"Field-referenced\"! That is the best endorsement one can give to a text' - Journal of Advanced Nursing 'The wide range of statistical techniques covered combined with good accompanying background explanations, communicated in a relaxed, affable style, make this book a useful addition to the bookshelves of both practitioners and teachers of statistics alike in the social sciences' - Peter Watson, MRC Cognition and Brain Sciences Unit, Cambridge and Chair of ASSESS, Independent European Group of SPSS Users 'The Second Edition of Andy Field's Discovering Statistics Using SPSS is an excellent book and a valuable addition to the teaching of statistics in the behavioral sciences. The title of the book accurately reflects the approach taken. This is not simply a primer on how to use SPSS, but is a very good statistics text using SPSS as a vehicle for illustrating and expanding on the statistical content of the book. At the same time it also serves as a manual for SPSS, and has taught me things that I had not known about the software. One advantage of the text is that it is not tied specifically to the latest version of SPSS. Although the examples use version 12.0, there are many references to the difference the students will find if they are using an earlier version. A good example of how the text is structured can be seen in Chapters 8 and 9. Chapter 8 provides an introduction to the analysis of variance, and roughly the first 40 pages are devoted to statistical issues. Only after that introduction does the author move to a discussion of using SPSS to run the analyses. Chapter 9 deals with the analysis of covariance, and here the author moves almost immediately to SPSS printout, having laid most of the groundwork in the previous chapter. I find this flexible approach to the blending of content and software to be an effective way of teaching the material. It is impossible to review this book without commenting on Andy's particular style. I enjoyed it immensely and think that it would appeal to both students and their instructors. It is refreshing to see someone who doesn't take himself too seriously' - David C Howell, Professor Emeritus, University of Vermont 'The new edition of Field's textbook confirms its place as the best statistics text for undergraduate social science students. It provides support for those less confident about statistical analysis whilst having sufficient depth that it will still be valuable to more mathematically experienced people. There is a focus throughout on the practical aspects of data analysis and interpretation whilst at the same time emphasizing the importance of rigour and a good understating of theory essential reading' - Dr Ian Walker, Department of Psychology, University of Bath 'Very useful, valuable and interesting. Summing up: Highly recommended' - CHOICE, Current Reviews for Academic Librarians This new edition of Field's textbook provides students of statistical methods with everything they need to understand, use and report statistics - at every level. Written in Andy Field's vivid and entertaining style, and furnished with playful examples from everyday student life (among other places), the book forms an accessible gateway into the often intimidating world of statistics and a unique opportunity for students to ground their knowledge of statistics through the use of SPSS.

    "description": "In recent years there has been a resurgence of interest in the study of delay differential equations motivated largely by new applications in physics, biology, ecology, and physiology. The aim of this monograph is to present a reasonably self-contained account of the advances in the oscillation theory of this class of equations. Throughout, the main topics of study are shown in action, with applications to such diverse problems as insect population estimations, logistic equations in ecology, the survival of red blood cells in animals, integro-differential equations, and the motion of the tips of growing plants. The authors begin by reviewing the basic theory of delay differential equations, including the fundamental results of existence and uniqueness of solutions and the theory of the Laplace and z-transforms. Little prior knowledge of the subject is required other than a firm grounding in the main techniques of differential equation theory. As a result, this book provides an invaluable reference to the recent work both for mathematicians and for all those whose research includes the study of this fascinating class of differential equations.",

    "description": "The first practical look at spatial statistics for the scientist and engineer. Designed for the scientific and engineering professional eager to exploit its enormous potential, Statistics for Spatial Data is a primer to the theory as well as the nuts-and-bolts of this influential technique. Focusing on the three areas of geostatistical data, lattice data, and point patterns, the book sheds light on the link between data and model, and reveals how spatial statistical models can be used to solve a host of problems in science and engineering. Revised to reflect state-of-the-art developments, this edition also features many detailed examples, numerous illustrations, and over 1,000 references. The first fully comprehensive introduction, Statistics for Spatial Data is an essential guide for professionals in biology, earth science, civil, electrical, and agricultural engineering, geography, epidemiology, and ecology. \"This excellent book, which presents the most important branches of modern spatial statistics in an exemplary manner, will become a basic reference book and will popularize many methods which have been used until now only by small circles of specialists.\" -Mathematical Reviews \"The majority of geoscientists should make sure they have access to this volume, while for those who are actively involved in applying statistical methods to data (of all sorts) this book should be in their personal libraries. As a compendium of statistical procedures to use to analyze data, this volume will surely provide a good solid framework for some time to come.\" -Geophysics",

    "description": "This volume is the first to offer a comprehensive, research-based, multi-faceted look at issues in early algebra. In recent years, the National Council for Teachers of Mathematics has recommended that algebra become a strand flowing throughout the K-12 curriculum, and the 2003 RAND Mathematics Study Panel has recommended that algebra be \"the initial topical choice for focused and coordinated research and development [in K-12 mathematics].\" The book provides a rationale for a stronger and more sustained approach to algebra in school, as well as concrete examples of how algebraic reasoning may be developed in the early grades. It is organized around three themes: *The Nature of Early Algebra *Students' Capacity for Algebraic Thinking *Issues of Implementation: Taking Early Algebra to the Classrooms The contributors to this landmark volume have been at the forefront of an effort to integrate algebra into the existing early grades mathematics curriculum. They include scholars who have been developing the conceptual foundations for such changes as well as researchers and developers who have led empirical investigations in school settings. Algebra in the Early Gradesaims to bridge the worlds of research, practice, design, and theory for educators, researchers, students, policy makers, and curriculum developers in mathematics education.",

    "description": "The authoritative reference on nonparametric methods for evaluating longitudinal data in factorial designs Broadening the range of techniques that can be used to evaluate longitudinal data, Nonparametric Analysis of Longitudinal Data in Factorial Experiments presents nonparametric methods of evaluation that supplement the generalized linear models approach. Emphasizing the practical application of these methods in statistical procedures, this book provides a unified approach for the analysis of factorial designs involving longitudinal data that is appropriate for metric data, count data, ordered categorical data, and dichotomous data. Topics covered include nonparametric models, effects and hypotheses in experimental design, estimators for relative effects, experiments for one and several groups of subjects, multifactorial experiments, dependent replications, and experiments with numerous time points. The basic mathematical principles for the methods introduced here are described in theory, consistent with the book's minimal math requirements. Simple approximations for small data sets are provided, as well as ample chapter exercises to test skills, an appendix that includes original data for the examples used throughout the book, and downloadable SAS-IML macros for implementing the more extensive calculations. All applications are designed to be useful in many fields. Generously supplemented with more than 110 graphs and tables, Nonparametric Analysis of Longitudinal Data in Factorial Experiments is an essential reference for statisticians and biometricians, researchers in clinical trials, psychological studies, and in the fields of forestry, agriculture, sociology, ecology, and biology, as well as graduate students in statistics and biostatistics.",

    "publishedDate": "1995",
    "description": "A traditional approach to developing multivariate statistical theory is algebraic. Sets of observations are represented by matrices, linear combinations are formed from these matrices by multiplying them by coefficient matrices, and useful statistics are found by imposing various criteria of optimization on these combinations. Matrix algebra is the vehicle for these calculations. A second approach is computational. Since many users find that they do not need to know the mathematical basis of the techniques as long as they have a way to transform data into results, the computation can be done by a package of computer programs that somebody else has written. An approach from this perspective emphasizes how the computer packages are used, and is usually coupled with rules that allow one to extract the most important numbers from the output and interpret them. Useful as both approaches are--particularly when combined--they can overlook an important aspect of multivariate analysis. To apply it correctly, one needs a way to conceptualize the multivariate relationships that exist among variables. This book is designed to help the reader develop a way of thinking about multivariate statistics, as well as to understand in a broader and more intuitive sense what the procedures do and how their results are interpreted. Presenting important procedures of multivariate statistical theory geometrically, the author hopes that this emphasis on the geometry will give the reader a coherent picture into which all the multivariate techniques fit.",

    "description": "The only single-source--now completely updated and revised--to offer a unified treatment of the theory, methodology, and applications of the EM algorithm Complete with updates that capture developments from the past decade, The EM Algorithm and Extensions, Second Edition successfully provides a basic understanding of the EM algorithm by describing its inception, implementation, and applicability in numerous statistical contexts. In conjunction with the fundamentals of the topic, the authors discuss convergence issues and computation of standard errors, and, in addition, unveil many parallels and connections between the EM algorithm and Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms. Thorough discussions on the complexities and drawbacks that arise from the basic EM algorithm, such as slow convergence and lack of an in-built procedure to compute the covariance matrix of parameter estimates, are also presented. While the general philosophy of the First Edition has been maintained, this timely new edition has been updated, revised, and expanded to include: New chapters on Monte Carlo versions of the EM algorithm and generalizations of the EM algorithm New results on convergence, including convergence of the EM algorithm in constrained parameter spaces Expanded discussion of standard error computation methods, such as methods for categorical data and methods based on numerical differentiation Coverage of the interval EM, which locates all stationary points in a designated region of the parameter space Exploration of the EM algorithm's relationship with the Gibbs sampler and other Markov chain Monte Carlo methods Plentiful pedagogical elements-chapter introductions, lists of examples, author and subject indices, computer-drawn graphics, and a related Web site The EM Algorithm and Extensions, Second Edition serves as an excellent text for graduate-level statistics students and is also a comprehensive resource for theoreticians, practitioners, and researchers in the social and physical sciences who would like to extend their knowledge of the EM algorithm.",

    "description": "During the 1980s the technology of modal testing became very widely practised in all those engineering disciplines where vibration and other dynamic phenomena affect the behaviour and performance of structures and machines. The techniques involved in carrying out a modal test were developed to a high degree of sophistication while the applications to which the results of these tests could be put became more numerous and more powerful. At the same time as the advantages of modal testing were being enjoyed by an increasing audience, some of the drawbacks of inexpert use of the technology were being learned and recorded. These experiences reinforced the need for a thorough understanding of fundamentals upon which modal testing is based, and of the detailed workings of the various phases and processes which make up a successful test. In this book, all the steps involved in planning, executing, interpreting and applying the results from a modal test are described in straightforward terms. Efforts are made throughout to ensure that the reader understands the physics of the various stages as well as (if not before) the mathematics. This edition has brought the previous book up to date by including all the new and improved techniques which have emerged during the 15 years since the first edition was written. The more powerful applications are developed in more detail than previously and some new topics have been introduced, notable amongst which are the application of modal testing to rotating machinery and the use of the scanning laser vibrometer.",

    "description": "¿Puede un sistema comprenderse a sí mismo ? Si esta pregunta se refiere a la mente humana, entonces nos encontramos ante una cuestión clave del pensamiento científico. Y de la filosofía. Y del arte. Investigar este misterio es una aventura que recorre la matemática, la física, la biología, la psicología y muy especialmente, el lenguaje. Douglas R. Hofstadter, joven y ya célebre científico, nos abre la puerta del enigma con la belleza y la alegría creadora de su estilo. Sorprendentes paralelismos ocultos entre los grabados de Escher y la música de Bach nos remiten a las paradojas clásicas de los antiguos griegos y a un teorema de la lógica matemática moderna que ha estremecido el pensamiento del siglo XX : el de Kurt Gödel. Todo lenguaje, todo sistema formal, todo programa de ordenador, todo proceso de pensamiento, llegan, tarde o temprano, a la situación límite de la autorreferencia : de querer expresarse sobre sí mismos. Surge entonces la emoción del infinito, como dos espejos enfrentados y obligados a reflejarse mutua e indefinidamente. Gödel, Escher, Bach : un Eterno y Grácil Bucle, es una obra de arte escrita por un sabio. Versa sobre los misterios del pensamiento e incluye, ella misma, sus propios misterios. Por ello su traducción ha supuesto también una larga, azarosa y laboriosa aventura que el propio autor ha vivido y que relata en un prólogo especialmente escrito para esta versión española.",

Regarded by many as a seminal book in the field of mathematics competitions, the first edition of A Mathematical Mosaic has received wide acclaim from mathematics teachers, professors and the mathematics community at large. In a review in The Mathematics Teacher, high school teacher John Cocharo wrote, “Without a doubt, this book is a must for any library, teacher's reference or student's amusement.” André Toom in his review in the Mathematical Monthly observed, “[A Mathematical Mosaic] speaks in an interesting and understandable way about number theory, combinatorics, game theory, geometry, and calculus, to say nothing about magic tricks, puzzles and other digressions. What is most important is that whenever Vakil starts to discuss something, he never leaves the reader without a piece of exact, rigorous knowledge.”",

    "description": "We live in a world that is not quite \"right.\" The central tenet of statistical inquiry is that Observation = Truth + Error because even the most careful of scientific investigations have always been bedeviled by uncertainty. Our attempts to measure things are plagued with small errors. Our attempts to understand our world are blocked by blunders. And, unfortunately, in some cases, people have been known to lie. In this long-awaited follow-up to his well-regarded bestseller, The Lady Tasting Tea, David Salsburg opens a door to the amazing widespread use of statistical methods by looking at historical examples of errors, blunders and lies from areas as diverse as archeology, law, economics, medicine, psychology, sociology, Biblical studies, history, and war-time espionage. In doing so, he shows how, upon closer statistical investigation, errors and blunders often lead to useful information. And how statistical methods have been used to uncover falsified data. Beginning with Edmund Halley’s examination of the Transit of Venus and ending with a discussion of how many tanks Rommel had during the Second World War, the author invites the reader to come along on this easily accessible and fascinating journey of how to identify the nature of errors, minimize the effects of blunders, and figure out who the liars are.",

    "description": "Numerical Methods for Ordinary Differential Systems The Initial Value Problem J. D. Lambert Professor of Numerical Analysis University of Dundee Scotland In 1973 the author published a book entitled Computational Methods in Ordinary Differential Equations. Since then, there have been many new developments in this subject and the emphasis has changed substantially. This book reflects these changes; it is intended not as a revision of the earlier work but as a complete replacement for it. Although some basic material appears in both books, the treatment given here is generally different and there is very little overlap. In 1973 there were many methods competing for attention but more recently there has been increasing emphasis on just a few classes of methods for which sophisticated implementations now exist. This book places much more emphasis on such implementations—and on the important topic of stiffness—than did its predecessor. Also included are accounts of the structure of variable-step, variable-order methods, the Butcher and the Albrecht theories for Runge—Kutta methods, order stars and nonlinear stability theory. The author has taken a middle road between analytical rigour and a purely computational approach, key results being stated as theorems but proofs being provided only where they aid the reader’s understanding of the result. Numerous exercises, from the straightforward to the demanding, are included in the text. This book will appeal to advanced students and teachers of numerical analysis and to users of numerical methods who wish to understand how algorithms for ordinary differential systems work and, on occasion, fail to work.",

    "description": "The definitive guide to statistical thinking Statistics are everywhere, as integral to science as they are to business, and in the popular media hundreds of times a day. In this age of big data, a basic grasp of statistical literacy is more important than ever if we want to separate the fact from the fiction, the ostentatious embellishments from the raw evidence -- and even more so if we hope to participate in the future, rather than being simple bystanders. In The Art of Statistics, world-renowned statistician David Spiegelhalter shows readers how to derive knowledge from raw data by focusing on the concepts and connections behind the math. Drawing on real world examples to introduce complex issues, he shows us how statistics can help us determine the luckiest passenger on the Titanic, whether a notorious serial killer could have been caught earlier, and if screening for ovarian cancer is beneficial. The Art of Statistics not only shows us how mathematicians have used statistical science to solve these problems -- it teaches us how we too can think like statisticians. We learn how to clarify our questions, assumptions, and expectations when approaching a problem, and -- perhaps even more importantly -- we learn how to responsibly interpret the answers we receive. Combining the incomparable insight of an expert with the playful enthusiasm of an aficionado, The Art of Statistics is the definitive guide to stats that every modern person needs.",

Der klare und übersichtliche Aufbau berücksichtigt, daß schon frühzeitig die mathematischen Hilfsmittel erörtert werden, die zum Verständnis der physikalischen Grundvorlesungen unerläßlich sind. In Verbindung mit Band 1 ist so ein Leitfaden für das Studium der Analysis entstanden, der das in den ersten beiden Studiensemestern zu erwerbende mathematische Grundwissen umfaßt. Ausführliche Beweise und Erläuterungen sowie zahlreiche Beispiele und interessante Übungsaufgaben eignen es sehr gut für das Selbststudium. Ein klarer und übersichtlicher Aufbau und eine geschickte Gliederung des Stoffes ermöglichen, das erste Studium auf Kernbereiche zu beschränken. Geometrische Intuition und historische Motivation in Verbindung mit einer maßvollen Abstraktion kennzeichnen diese moderne Einführung in die Analysis.",

Neben dem üblichen Stoff einer Analysis 2 (Funktionenräume, Integration, Differentialrechnung für Funktionen in mehreren Veränderlichen) enthält das Buch eine Reihe von Besonderheiten, die es sonst in keinem Lehrbuch gibt. Zum Beispiel ist der Satz von Liouville enthalten, durch den garantiert wird, dass gewisse einfache Funktionen nicht geschlossen integriert werden können. Im Kapitel \"Anwendungen der Integralrechnung\" gibt es einen Abschnitt zur Zahlentheorie, in dem Transzendenzbeweise für konkrete Zahlen - unter anderem für die Zahl e - geführt werden; in diesem Kapitel wird auch der Existenzsatz von Picard-Lindelöf behandelt. Und schließlich gibt es noch einen ausführlichen Anhang zum Thema \"Englisch für Mathematiker\": Was muss man beachten, wenn man sich auf Englisch über Mathematik unterhalten möchte?",

    "publisher": "Springer Science & Business Media",

    "description": "This book grew out of an effort to salvage a potentially useful idea for greatly simplifying traditional quantitative risk assessments of the human health consequences of using antibiotics in food animals. In 2001, the United States FDA’s Center for Veterinary Medicine (CVM) (FDA-CVM, 2001) published a risk assessment model for potential adverse human health consequences of using a certain class of antibiotics, fluoroquinolones, to treat flocks of chickens with fatal respiratory disease caused by infectious bacteria. CVM’s concern was that fluoroquinolones are also used in human medicine, raising the possibility that fluoroquinolone-resistant strains of bacteria selected by use of fluoroquinolones in chickens might infect humans and then prove resistant to treatment with human medicines in the same class of antibiotics, such as ciprofloxacin. As a foundation for its risk assessment model, CVM proposed a dramatically simple approach that skipped many of the steps in traditional risk assessment. The basic idea was to assume that human health risks were directly proportional to some suitably defined exposure metric. In symbols: Risk = K × Exposure, where “Exposure” would be defined in terms of a metric such as total production of chicken contaminated with fluoroquinolone-resistant bacteria that might cause human illnesses, and “Risk” would describe the expected number of cases per year of human illness due to fluoroquinolone-resistant bacterial infections caused by chicken and treated with fluoroquinolones.",

    "description": "This book is not an intellectual history or popular summary of recent work on consciousness in humans. Bernard Baars (1988), Edelman and Tononi (2000), and many others, have written such, and done it well indeed. This book, rather, brings the powerful analytic machinery of communication theory to bear on the Global Neuronal Workspace (GNW) model of consciousness which Baars introduced, and does so in a formal mathematical manner. It is not the first such attempt. The philospher Fred Dretske (1981), indep- dent of Baars, long ago outlined how information theory might illuminate the understanding of mind. Adapting his approach on the necessary conditions for mental process, we apply a previously-developed information theory analysis of interacting cognitive biological and social modules to Baars' GNW, which has become the principal candidate for a 'standard model' of consciousness. Invoking an obvious canonical homology with statistical physics, the method, when iterated in the spirit of the Hierarchical Linear Model of regression theory, generates a fluctuating dynamic threshold for consciousness which is similar to a tunable phase transition in a physical system. The phenomenon is, however, constrained to a manifold/atlas structure analogous to a retina; an adaptable Rate Distortion manifold, whose 'topology', in a large sense, reflects the hierarchy of embedding constraints acting on consciousness. This view greatly extends what Baars has characterized as 'contexts.",

    "description": "Form Symmetries and Reduction of Order in Difference Equations presents a new approach to the formulation and analysis of difference equations in which the underlying space is typically an algebraic group. In some problems and applications, an additional algebraic or topological structure is assumed in order to define equations and obtain significant results about them. Reflecting the author’s past research experience, the majority of examples involve equations in finite dimensional Euclidean spaces. The book first introduces difference equations on groups, building a foundation for later chapters and illustrating the wide variety of possible formulations and interpretations of difference equations that occur in concrete contexts. The author then proposes a systematic method of decomposition for recursive difference equations that uses a semiconjugate relation between maps. Focusing on large classes of difference equations, he shows how to find the semiconjugate relations and accompanying factorizations of two difference equations with strictly lower orders. The final chapter goes beyond semiconjugacy by extending the fundamental ideas based on form symmetries to nonrecursive difference equations. With numerous examples and exercises, this book is an ideal introduction to an exciting new domain in the area of difference equations. It takes a fresh and all-inclusive look at difference equations and develops a systematic procedure for examining how these equations are constructed and solved.",
