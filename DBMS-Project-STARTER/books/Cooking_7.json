    "description": "2018 James Beard Award Winner: Best American Cookbook Named one of the Best Cookbooks of 2017 by NPR, The Village Voice, Smithsonian Magazine, UPROXX, New York Magazine, San Francisco Chronicle, Mpls. St. PaulMagazine and others Here is real food--our indigenous American fruits and vegetables, the wild and foraged ingredients, game and fish. Locally sourced, seasonal, \"clean\" ingredients and nose-to-tail cooking are nothing new to Sean Sherman, the Oglala Lakota chef and founder of The Sioux Chef. In his breakout book, The Sioux Chef's Indigenous Kitchen, Sherman shares his approach to creating boldly seasoned foods that are vibrant, healthful, at once elegant and easy. Sherman dispels outdated notions of Native American fare--no fry bread or Indian tacos here--and no European staples such as wheat flour, dairy products, sugar, and domestic pork and beef. The Sioux Chef's healthful plates embrace venison and rabbit, river and lake trout, duck and quail, wild turkey, blueberries, sage, sumac, timpsula or wild turnip, plums, purslane, and abundant wildflowers. Contemporary and authentic, his dishes feature cedar braised bison, griddled wild rice cakes, amaranth crackers with smoked white bean paste, three sisters salad, deviled duck eggs, smoked turkey soup, dried meats, roasted corn sorbet, and hazelnut-maple bites. The Sioux Chef's Indigenous Kitchen is a rich education and a delectable introduction to modern indigenous cuisine of the Dakota and Minnesota territories, with a vision and approach to food that travels well beyond those borders.",

Enter Ketotarian - Dr Will Cole's revolutionary programme that offers a fresh, modern twist on keto by harnessing the same fat-burning power, but with the nutritious, delicious benefits of a mostly plant-based plate. It includes 75 recipes that are veggie, vegan and pescatarian, a four-week meal plan and lots of practical tips that will help you on your journey to optimum health, renewed energy and improved brain function. Let the Ketotarian revolution begin! 'This important book artfully expands access to the powerfully beneficial ketogenic diet. Shifting the body's fuel from sugar to fat is immensely powerful and optimises health. Ketotarian presents a user-friendly, actionable plan so that everyone can embrace and implement this exciting and leading-edge science.' - Dr David Perlmutter, New York Times bestselling author of Grain Brain and The Grain Brain Whole Life Plan",

Les préparations simples (un robot et un blender suffisent) permettent une préservation parfaite des nutriments. Mais ce qui importe le plus à Marie-Sophie L., c’est de louer les vertus gustatives des préparations sans cuisson pour révéler la complexité de certains légumes qui se livrent pleinement dans toute leur insolente vivacité ! Ainsi ce « cheesecake » bluffant de gourmandise et de saveurs, réalisé sans œufs ni laitage, et sans cuisson, ou ce « risotto » de panais aux cèpes où les notes réglissées, vives et sucrées du panais dansent littéralement avec le parfum chaud et puissant des cèpes pour rebondir en bouche avec beaucoup d’aisance et de persistance. Un enchantement inoubliable. Spaghetti de courgettes à la sauce napolitaine / Cheesecake aux framboises / Gâteau au cacao corsé et au carawmel tendre / Pruneaux au bacon d’aubergine / Velouté de poivron fumé / Tombée d’épinards / Béchamel de cajou à la muscade et au poivre noir / Rawtatouille...",

    "description": "This book is all about creating beautiful and delicious food...without stress and without fuss. Marco Pierre White serves up more than 100 recipes and shows the home cook how to get big flavours from store-cupboard ingredients.The book has sections for starters, shellfish, fish, meat, poultry, desserts, and Marco uses bottles, jars and packets to make divine sauces, syrups and dressings. Olive oil, honey, mustard, soy sauce, vinegar, Hellmann's, Heinz and Knorr - they are all on the lists of ingredients here. And the three main ingredients of Marco Made Easy are: Simple, Fast and Fun. 'It'll take longer to wash the dishes,' he says, 'than it will to make them.'Tomato ketchup helps to make Salmon Ketchup; that bottle of Lea and Perrins brings life to the sauce for peppered steak; and beef casserole is transformed by a can (or two) of Guinness mixed with a carton of prune juice. Desserts, too, require little skill. Jamaican Mess, made with bananas, shop-bought custard and Carnation caramel sauce - is creamy, rich and swee. Who could say no? Beautiful photographs of each stunning dish enable the reader to copy the master chef¿s presentation: you don't need to be an artist. As Marco says of this revolutionary cook book, `It's for anyone who loves food but hates aggro'.'",

    "description": "Proust's famous madeleine captures the power of food to evoke some of our deepest memories. Why does food hold such power? What does the growing commodification and globalization of food mean for our capacity to store the past in our meals ñ in the smell of olive oil or the taste of a fresh-cut fig? This book offers a theoretical account of the interrelationship of culture, food and memory. Sutton challenges and expands anthropology's current focus on issues of embodiment, memory and material culture, especially in relation to transnational migration and the flow of culture across borders and boundaries. The Greek island of Kalymnos in the eastern Aegean, where Islanders claim to remember meals long past -- both humble and spectacular ñ provides the main setting for these issues, as well as comparative materials drawn from England and the United States. Despite the growing interest in anthropological accounts of food and in the cultural construction of memory, the intersection of food with memory has not been accorded sustained examination. Cultural practices of feasting and fasting, global flows of food as both gifts and commodities, the rise of processed food and the relationship of orally transmitted recipes to the vast market in speciality cookbooks tie traditional anthropological mainstays such as ritual, exchange and death to more current concerns with structure and history, cognition and the 'anthropology of the senses'. Arguing for the crucial role of a simultaneous consideration of food and memory, this book significantly advances our understanding of cultural processes and reformulates current theoretical preoccupations.",

    "description": "\"While reading the cookbook, I could not only 'hear' Leah talking to me about her food, heritage and family, but I could smell and taste the flavor from the great recipes and the great food that has made Dooky Chase's my favorite restaurant.\" -Joe Cahn, executive director, New Orleans School of Cooking \"I can't mention my favorite books without adding this cookbook to the list. The Queen of Creole Cuisine still has the spirit of a woman who has run of the kitchen at New Orleans' Dooky Chase for over fifty years. I love Leah and her cookbook is a keeper.\" -Marcus Samuelsson, chef, author, and restaurateur From the inception of Dooky Chase's Restaurant in 1941, the establishment has functioned as a gathering place for the black political community of New Orleans, with the incomparable Leah Chase at the center of it all. As life for blacks gradually began to change, the restaurant became a hub of political activity during the Civil Rights movement of the '60s. Chase attributes the initial popularity of the new Dooky Chase to a change in her gumbo recipe, insisting, \"It wasn't until I changed the whole menu to Creole that I really got acceptance from everybody.\" She originally tried to gain patrons by serving dishes such as jambalaya, fried chicken, shrimp, and oysters-foods that blacks wouldn't normally eat at home-but eventually changed the entire menu. Inventive as well as traditional Creole dishes are the mainstay of Chase's repertoire. B.L.T. Soup, Bushalini, Stewed Tripe with Pigs' Feet, Grillades, Squirrel Pie, Low-Sodium Creole Red Kidney Beans, Stuffed Onions, and Old-Fashioned Bread Pudding have all graced the tables of Dooky Chase.",

    "description": "“The Yoga Plate brings us compassion and living right for our families, our planet and our animals—a beautiful offering for good all around.” Julie Piatt and Rich Roll Bestselling authors, wellness leaders, chefs, and podcast hosts Discover 108 nourishing and delicious vegan recipes in the first modern cookbook to marry yoga’s principle of ahimsa with nutrition We take a lot of care when it comes to choosing the proper clothing for yoga, the right accessories, the best studio—but primary to these considerations is an often overlooked yet vital component of practice: our diet. How we eat might be the most important aspect of an effective practice. How we eat is a huge component to the practice because it represents how we treat and nourish ourselves. By changing the way we eat physically and consciously, we can put ourselves on the path to greater well-being. In The Yoga Plate, LA-based yoga power couple Tamal and Victoria Dodge introduce readers to the philosophy of yoga as it is reflected in our eating choices. The 108 recipes are designed according to the concept of ahimsa, or non-harm. “Consciously or not, we can cause a lot of harm with our eating habits,” explain the authors. “Living with ahimsa means we try to cause the least harm possible to all living creatures.” Each recipe takes you through your daily practice of yoga, starting with “Morning Meditations,” where you’ll find smoothies and breakfasts to fuel and power you through the day; “A Plate Full of Prana,” with snacks, soups, and salads to revitalize your system; “A Bowl Full of Yin,” with recipes to help cultivate a centered mood; and “Sweet Savasana” for restorative and beneficial dessert options. A well-rounded yoga practice includes a conscious approach to the things we eat. With The Yoga Plate, readers can make each meal a sacred activity to support both our practice and well-being.",

Since adopting a low-carb diet he has lost almost 4 stone and put his diabetes into remission - transforming his and his family's health. Working with nutritionist Jenny Phillips, Giancarlo and his wife Katie show you how to enjoy a low carb but not no-carb way of life with simple recipes using easy-to-source ingredients that will fill you up without fattening you up. Steak and Chips are still on the menu, as are delicious curries such as Butter Chicken and Spinach Paneer, even puddings like Hot Chocolate Pots or Peanut Butter & Jelly Cake. An initial diagnosis of diabetes can be shocking and the masses of information daunting, but Katie and Giancarlo share their personal experience of diabetes and weight loss to empower you to make your own informed decisions about food, without sacrificing any of the flavour.",

In Kitchen Confidential, he expanded that appetizer into a deliciously funny, delectable shocking banquet that lays out his 25 years of sex, drugs, and haute cuisine. From his first oyster in the Gironde to the kitchen of the Rainbow Room atop Rockefeller Center, from the restaurants of Tokyo to the drug dealers of the East Village, from the mobsters to the rats, Bourdain's brilliantly written, wild-but-true tales make the belly ache with laughter.",

    "description": "The beloved sequel to the bestselling classic, Mastering the Art of French Cooking, Volume II presents more fantastic French recipes for home cooks. Working from the principle that “mastering any art is a continuing process,” here Julia Child and Simone Beck have gathered together a brilliant selection of new dishes that will bring you to a yet higher level of culinary mastery. They have searched out more of the classic dishes and regional specialties of France, and adapted them so that Americans, working with American ingredients, in American kitchens, can achieve the incomparable flavors and aromas that bring up a rush of memories—of lunch at a country inn in Provence, of an evening at a great Paris restaurant, of the essential cooking of France. From French bread to salted goose, from peasant ragoûts to royal Napoleons, recipes are written with the same detail, exactness, and clarity that are the soul of Mastering the Art of French Cooking.",

    "description": "A kitchen classic for nearly 35 years. Hailed by Time magazine as \"a minor masterpiece\" when it first appeared in 1984, On Food and Cooking is the bible to which food lovers and professional chefs worldwide turn for an understanding of where our foods come from, what exactly they're made of, and how cooking transforms them into something new and delicious. For its twentieth anniversary, Harold McGee prepared a new, fully revised and updated edition of On Food and Cooking. He has rewritten the text almost completely, expanded it by two-thirds, and commissioned more than 100 new illustrations. As compulsively readable and engaging as ever, the new On Food and Cooking provides countless eye-opening insights into food, its preparation, and its enjoyment. On Food and Cooking pioneered the translation of technical food science into cook-friendly kitchen science and helped birth the inventive culinary movement known as \"molecular gastronomy.\" Though other books have been written about kitchen science, On Food and Cooking remains unmatched in the accuracy, clarity, and thoroughness of its explanations, and the intriguing way in which it blends science with the historical evolution of foods and cooking techniques. Among the major themes addressed throughout the new edition are: · Traditional and modern methods of food production and their influences on food quality · The great diversity of methods by which people in different places and times have prepared the same ingredients · Tips for selecting the best ingredients and preparing them successfully · The particular substances that give foods their flavors, and that give us pleasure · Our evolving knowledge of the health benefits and risks of foods On Food and Cooking is an invaluable and monumental compendium of basic information about ingredients, cooking methods, and the pleasures of eating. It will delight and fascinate anyone who has ever cooked, savored, or wondered about food.",

First published in France in 1825, this remarkable book reflected a new era in French cuisine: the advent of the restaurant, which gave the bourgeoisie the opportunity to select their dishes with precision and anticipation. Yet the author also gives his views on taste, diet and maintaining a healthy weight, on digestion, sleep, dreams and being a gourmand. Witty, shrewd and anecdotal, The Physiology of Taste not only contains some remarkable recipes, it an elegant argument for the pleasures of good food and a hearty appetite.",

    "description": "“Here’s a cookbook you’ll pull from the shelf every time you ask yourself, ‘What should I serve with this?’ Tara Mataraza Desmond has written an inspired and creative cookbook dedicated entirely to side dishes. Accessorizing the main element of the meal, whether for a weeknight dinner, family get-together, or holiday feast, needs to be artful, nourishing, and practical. Choosing Sides brings excitement to every meal with these innovative and contemporary side dishes.” ––Diane Morgan, author of Roots: The Definitive Compendium “This is an extraordinary collection, able to turn anyone who can roast a chicken or grill a lamb chop into a top chef. Nobody needs another recipe for meatloaf, but accompany your old standby with the likes of Smoked Gouda Grits and Red Grape and Bacon Salad (easy to throw together while the meatloaf is in the oven), and I guarantee your best friend’s other best friends will cringe with jealousy.” ––Andrew Schloss, author of Art of the Slow Cooker and Cooking Slow: Recipes for Slowing Down and Cooking More “Oh, to be an entrée surrounded by Tara Mataraza Desmond’s flavorful, colorful, vibrant sides! In Choosing Sides, Tara offers a modern spin on the humble, oft-neglected accompaniment. Her Chorizo Chard; Blood Orange Wild Rice; and Persimmon, Pomegranate, and Pistachio Salad are but three examples for how to turn supporting players into shining culinary stars. Tara can fill my plate any day.” ––Cheryl Sternman Rule, author of Ripe: A Fresh, Colorful Approach to Fruits and Vegetables Choosing Sides, a cookbook devoted entirely to side dishes, honors the standards and offers fresh ideas for new favorites. It capitalizes on our obsession with accessorizing meals using quality ingredients in inspired, varied, and memorable recipes. Every recipe offers multiple entrée suggestions and helps cooks design an entire meal. Instead of tagging bland afterthoughts on your plate at the last minute, you can create exciting combinations. The chapters offer a range of recipes for broad appeal, crossing cuisines, techniques, and complexity. You’ll find recipes for breakfast, intimate gatherings, picnics, holidays, and more. Coconut Cilantro Toasted Israeli Couscous, Pumpkin Cozy Rolls, Honey Balsamic Peaches and Burrata, and Sesame Braised Bok Choy are just a few. A helpful chart, organized by main entrée, gives you a quick look at what to serve with chicken, beef, fish, and the like. Choosing Sides is a singular source for answering the mealtime question, “What should I serve with this?”",

    "title": "Buzz",

    "authors": [
     "Stephen Braun"
    ],
    "publisher": "Oxford University Press",
    "publishedDate": "1996-10-31",
    "description": "Alcohol and caffeine are deeply woven into the fabric of life for most of the world's population, as close and as comfortable as a cup of coffee or a can of beer. Yet for most people they remain as mysterious and unpredictable as the spirits they were once thought to be. Now, in Buzz, Stephen Braun takes us on a myth-shattering tour of these two popular substances, one that blends fascinating science with colorful lore, and that includes cameo appearances by Shakespeare and Balzac, Buddhist monks and Arabian goat herders, even Mikhail Gorbachev and David Letterman (who once quipped, \"If it weren't for the coffee, I'd have no identifiable personality whatsoever\"). Much of what Braun reveals directly contradicts conventional wisdom about alcohol and caffeine. Braun shows, for instance, that alcohol is not simply a depressant as popularly believed, but is instead \"a pharmacy in a bottle\"--mimicking the action of drugs such as cocaine, amphetamine, valium, and opium. At low doses, it increases electrical activity in the same brain systems affected by stimulants, influences the same circuits targeted by valium, and causes the release of morphine-like compounds known as endorphins--all at the same time. This explains why alcohol can produce a range of reactions, from boisterous euphoria to dark, brooding hopelessness. Braun also shatters the myth that alcohol kills brain cells, reveals why wood alcohol or methanol causes blindness, and explains the biological reason behind the one-drink-per-hour sobriety rule (that's how long it takes the liver, working full tilt, to disable the 200 quintillion ethanol molecules found in a typical drink). The author then turns to caffeine and shows it to be no less remarkable. We discover that more than 100 plant species produce caffeine molecules in their seeds, leaves, or bark, a truly amazing distribution throughout nature (nicotine, in comparison, is found only in tobacco; opium only in the poppy). It's not surprising then that caffeine is far and away the most widely used mind altering substance on the planet, found in tea, coffee, cocoa, chocolate, soft drinks, and more than 2,000 non-prescription drugs. (Tea is the most popular drink on earth, with coffee a close second.) Braun also explores the role of caffeine in creativity: Johann Sebastian Bach, for one, loved coffee so much he wrote a Coffee Cantata (as Braun notes, no music captures the caffeinated experience better than one of Bachs frenetic fugues), Balzac would work for 12 hours non-stop, drinking coffee all the while, and Kant, Rousseau, and Voltaire all loved coffee. And throughout the book, Braun takes us on many engaging factual sidetrips--we learn, for instance, that Theodore Roosevelt coined the phrase \"Good to the last drop\" used by Maxwell House ever since; that distances between Tibetan villages are sometimes reckoned by the number of cups of tea needed to sustain a person (three cups being roughly 8 kilometers); and that John Pemberton's original recipe for Coca-Cola included not only kola extract, but also cocaine. Whether you are a sophisticated consumer of cabernet sauvignon and Kenya AA or just someone who needs a cup of joe in the morning and a cold one after work, you will find Buzz to be an eye-opening, informative, and often amusing look at two substances at once utterly familiar and deeply mysterious.",
