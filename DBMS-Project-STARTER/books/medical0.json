    "description": "Mechatronics integrates key systems from mechanical, electrical, electronic, and computer engineering to manufacture industrial products, processes, and operations. Intended as a textbook for courses in mechatronics or as an up-to-date reference for practicing engineers, the book uses extensive in-text, solved examples and computer simulations to cover the basic concepts. This book contains information from both the theoretical and application perspectives related to mechatronic systems. The self-explanatory block diagrams, examples, and numerous illustrations provide the reader with a self-study text to develop systems with motors, circuits, microprocessors, and controls. A CD-ROM with numerous simulations, software, and third-party applications accompanies the print version of the text.",

Obvious highlights include the explosion in the rate of discoveries of Kuiper belt objects; better understanding of dynamics of main belt asteroids and the processes affecting their injection into the inner planets crossing orbits; growing understanding of the importance of comets and asteroids in the delivery of volatiles to the inner planets and even possibly in life origin on the Earth; great acceleration of NEO discovery and more reliable prediction of their future threat to the Earth. All these topics are thoroughly addressed and discussed by the top-level specialists in the field on the most comprehensive and unprecedented basis. Owing to its interdisciplinary character the book will undoubtedly meet an interest of specialists in the different fields of astronomy, planetary and Earth sciences.",

    "description": "Here is a valuable book intended to help those occupational therapists working in mental health settings to refine their critical thinking about the group activities they select and the protocols they design. Experts focus on practicing sound clinical reasoning and clinical decision making to ensure careful assessment of which activities, structured in what fashion, are appropriate for particular populations. They also address the topic of providing services that are relevant, practical, have already delineated goals and objectives, produce outcome data, and can be replicated across settings. Group Protocols: A Psychosocial Compendium offers readers a systematic approach to the assessment and design of group protocols, plus a wide variety of sample protocols from which treatment strategies may be drawn. Because this volume represents a style of thinking rather than a singular theoretical frame of reference, it will be useful to any occupational therapist for whom groups are an essential aspect of professional practice.",

Although contracting has the potential to add benefits to health systems it also adds further complexity. Following a substantial health sector reform and the introduction of a purchaser-provider split contracting became a central part of the management of New Zealand's publicly funded health system during the period 1993 to 2000. This publication examines a number of different aspects of New Zealand's experience of using contracts in the health sector including the contracting process contract content and form purchaser-provider relationships including sources of tension and factors that alleviated tensions and issues related to monitoring and accountability. This publication may assist other countries that are using or are planning to use contracts within their health systems.",

    "description": "The publication embodied here represents the life work of a premier Russian scientist studying Sudden Cardiac Death. As one can gather from more than 35 first authored publications cited in the References, Dr. Rajskina has been involved with the investigation of mechanisms responsible for Sudden Cardiac Death for over 30 years. She has brought a classical approach to the sub ject, considering the effects of blood supply disturbances, electrophysiological changes that occur after regional ischemia, metabolic alterations, and the role of the autonomic nervous system in modulating these changes. These studies naturally lead to a consideration of interventions, based on her research, to prevent ventricular fibrillation after coronary artery occlusion. This is a wide ranging treatise indicative of a lifetime of study of the problem and filled with the richness of scientific experiments generated in its pursuit. There is so much in here that will be of interest to the arrhythmologist interested in Sudden Cardiac Death, whether this is on a single channel level, in vitro study of hearts, in vivo investigation of intact animals, or at the bedside. And throughout it all, statements are copiously documented with more than 850 references. That alone is worth hours of computer searching. I am very proud to have been asked by this outstanding scientist to write a brief Preface to her monumental contribution. All of us involved in the study of arrhythmic mechanisms responsible for Sudden Cardiac Death can hold Dr.",

    "description": "Most clinical practices are not prepared for a disaster, and failure to prepare for a disaster can have devastating consequences on a medical practice, the physicians, and the patients. Disaster Planning for the Clinical Practice describes the types of disasters that can affect medical practices, suggests steps for disaster planning, and identifies the necessary procedures for restarting the practice after a disaster has occurred. Natural disasters are not the most common casue of practice failure - man-made disasters such as computer crashes, power outages, and loss of electronic data are more likely to impact a medical practice. This book offers suggestions on the preparation of a disaster plan that can be easily implemented into any health practice, and discusses how to overcome both natural and man-made disasters. Each chapter features true disaster case studies, questions doctors or office managers need to answer, and step-by-step recommendations for the implementation of the disaster plan, as well as dozens of templates and forms ready for immediate use. This is an essential resource for all practices large, small, rural, and academic. Includes a user-friendly CD ROM with forms, questionnaires, and charts!",

    "description": "With the defeat of national health reform, many liberals have looked to the states as the source of health policy innovation. At the same time, many in the new Republican majority and several governors also support increased state control. In contrast, Michael S. Sparer convincingly argues that states by themselves can neither satisfy the liberal hope for universal coverage nor the conservative hope for cost containment. He also points to two critical drawbacks to a state-dominated health care system: the variation in coverage among states and the intergovernmental tension that would inevitably accompany such a change. Supporting his arguments, Sparer analyzes the contradictions in operations and policies between the New York and California Medicaid programs. For instance, why does New York spend an average of $7,286 on its Medicaid beneficiaries and California an average of $2,801? The answer, the author suggests, is rooted in bureaucratic politics. California officials enjoy significant bureaucratic autonomy, while the system in New York is fragmented, decentralized, and interest-group dominated. The book supports this conclusion by exploring nursing home and home care policy, hospital care policy, and managed care policy in the two states. Sparer's dissection of the consequences of state-based reform make a persuasive case for national health insurance.",

    "publisher": "Oxford University Press",

    "description": "Public health is a term much used in the media, by health professionals, and by activists. At the national or the local level there are ministries or departments of public health, whilst international agencies such as the World Health Organisation promote public health policies, and regional organisations such as the European Union have public health funding and policies. But what do we mean when we speak about 'public health'? In this Very Short Introduction Virginia Berridge explores the areas which fall under the remit of public health, and explains how the individual histories of different countries have come to cause great differences in the perception of the role and responsibilities of public health organisations. Thus, in the United States litigation on public health issues is common, but state involvement is less, while some Scandinavian countries have a tradition of state involvement or even state ownership of industries such as alcohol in connection with public health. In its narrowest sense, public health can refer to the health of a population, the longevity of individual members, and their freedom from disease, but it can also be anticipatory, geared to the prevention of illness, rather than simply the provision of care and treatment. In the way public health deals with healthy as well as sick people it is therefore a separate concept from health services, which deal with the sick population. Drawing on a wide range of international examples, Berridge demonstrates the central role of history to understanding the amorphous nature of public health today. ABOUT THE SERIES: The Very Short Introductions series from Oxford University Press contains hundreds of titles in almost every subject area. These pocket-sized books are the perfect way to get ahead in a new subject quickly. Our expert authors combine facts, analysis, perspective, new ideas, and enthusiasm to make interesting and challenging topics highly readable.",

    "description": "Power reduction is a central priority in battery-powered medical implantable devices, particularly pacemakers, to either increase battery lifetime or decrease size using a smaller battery. Low Power Analog CMOS for Cardiac Pacemakers proposes new techniques for the reduction of power consumption in analog integrated circuits. Our main example is the pacemaker sense channel, which is representative of a broader class of biomedical circuits aimed at qualitatively detecting biological signals. The first and second chapters are a tutorial presentation on implantable medical devices and pacemakers from the circuit designer point of view. This is illustrated by the requirements and solutions applied in our implementation of an industrial IC for pacemakers. There from, the book discusses the means for reduction of power consumption at three levels: base technology, power-oriented analytical synthesis procedures and circuit architecture. At the technology level, we analyze the impact that the application of the fully depleted silicon-on-insulator (FD SOI) technology has on this kind of analog circuits. The basic building block levels as well as the system level (pacemaker sense channel) are considered. Concerning the design technique, we apply a methodology, based on the transconductance to current ratio that exploits all regions of inversion of the MOS transistor. Various performance aspects of analog building blocks are modeled and a power optimization synthesis of OTAs for a given total settling time (including the slewing and linear regions) is proposed. At the circuit level, we present a new design approach of a class AB output stage suitable for micropower application. In our design approach, the usual advantages of the application of a class AB output stage are enhanced by the application of a transconductance multiplication effect. These techniques are tested in experimental prototypes of amplifiers and complete pacemaker sense channel implementations in SOI and standard bulk CMOS technologies. An ultra low consumption of 110 nA (0.3μ W) is achieved in a FD SOI sense channel implementation. Though primarily addressed to the pacemaker system, the techniques proposed are shown to have application in other contexts where power reduction is a main concern.",

It is free to read at Oxford Scholarship Online and offered as a free PDF download from OUP and selected open access locations. Whether it is a question of the age below which a child cannot be held liable for their actions, or the attribution of responsibility to defendants with mental illnesses, mental incapacity is a central concern for legal actors, policy makers, and legislators when it comes to crime and justice. Understanding mental incapacity in criminal law is notoriously difficult; it involves tracing overlapping and interlocking legal doctrines, current and past practices of evidence and proof, and also medical and social understandings of mental illness and incapacity. With its focus on the complex interaction of legal doctrines and practices relating to mental incapacity and knowledge - both expert and non-expert - of it, this book offers a fresh perspective on this topic. Bringing together previously disparate discussions on mental incapacity from law, psychology, and philosophy, this book provides a close study of this terrain of criminal law, analysing the development of mental incapacity doctrines through historical cases to the modern era. It maps the shifting boundaries around abnormality as constructed in law, arguing that the mental incapacity terrain has a distinct character - 'manifest madness'.",

    "description": "This timely volume fills a long-standing gap in the professional literature by providing an overview of contemporary assessment and rehabilitation of alcohol and chemical dependent substance abusers. Although many occupational therapists and other activity therapy staff work in substance abuse programs, few articles in occupational therapy literature address this relevant topic. Treatment of Substance Abuse: Psychosocial Occupational Therapy Approaches provides a unique overview of contemporary assessment and rehabilitiation of alcohol and chemical dependent substance abusers. The highlights of this insightful book include behavioral and educational frames of reference as well as specific treatment modalities such as stress management, activities of daily living, and leisure counseling. Contributors examine current polemics regarding programs that use methadone versus abstinence and theoretical concepts including the psychodynamic model with emphasis on the defensive structure underlying the abuser’s personality, as well as leveled conceptual framework for considering treatment. A number of practical techniques are discussed within the overall context of each article; hence the reader will find usable guidelines for establishing boundaries of treatment as well as discreet ideas about methods and practice. Roles and functions of varying disciplines are reviewed in an effort to discriminate role clarity and provide implications for practice in relation to different models. This issue is valuable to the OT who seeks an understanding of the varying viewpoints and current practice in the substance abuse field.",

    "description": "In recent years, the concept of environmental security has been adapted to include preparedness for acts of ecoterrorism. This latter term has now become synonymous with environmental terrorism where the perpetrator uses the environment as a weapon to harm an opponent. The intended outcome is usually large-scale deaths, severe damage to the environment, and instilling fear in the general population. This book explores various facets of ecoterrorism including the role of the state in pursuing and maintaining environmental security, a review of the concept of ecoterrorism, food security challenges and weaknesses, technological countermeasures to enable rapid detection or response, and existing pollution sources and hazards that may serve as targets for terrorist acts. In sum, this volume provides a useful overview for both the layperson and experienced researchers.",

    "description": "This second edition of Health Aspects of Aging serves to broaden the perspectives of societal change due to increases in life expectancy, as well as the effects of age-related changes as they impinge upon the provision of health care for older persons. The growing presence of a large number of persons aged 65 and older worldwide has propelled a re-evaluation of the nature of life that is protracted to 100 years and beyond. The emphasis in this second edition is to replace the prevailing problem approach to aging by a problem-solving approach. The problem-solving approach of this volume has allowed for the incorporation of the concept of new social structures and the development of intervention and prevention strategies along with new technologies. Such new products and health care measures include those that are deliberately aimed to offset debilities due to normal age changes, the onslaught of diseases, incongruous environments, and altered social states. Such a multi-disciplinary perspective underscores the fact that aging permeates not only biological systems, but clinical medicine, economics, ethics, and the very fabric of society. The chapters in this volume address these issues from the standpoints of diverse disciplines and professional positions. Since biological changes are primary issues, the aging process is largely described from the perspective of biological changes related to age and to particular dysfunctions. The environmental features and the potential introduction of technological interventions are interspersed within chapters, as well as finding primary focus in particular chapters. The maturity of the technology described in the chapters varies, from devices and systems that are nearly ready to be marketed to concepts and prototypes that are still in the design and developmental stages in the laboratory. The relationship between the provision of appropriate health care and the responsible utilization of technologies as described in this volume will serve to enhance the nature of life extension.",

    "description": "Examine the unique emotional challenges and issues that face couples of mixed HIV status today! Previous books on this subject—mostly written in the days when HIV/AIDS was considered a fatal rather than a chronic disease—focused on end-of-life issues. However, Couples of Mixed HIV Status: Clinical Issues and Interventions addresses the unique emotional challenges facing today’s couples of mixed HIV status and provides a conceptual framework for assessment and intervention. The book offers examples of how to apply emotionally focused couple therapy to help them work through issues including disclosure, the fear of HIV transmission, shifts in emotional intimacy, family planning, betrayal, mistrust, and uncertainty. This unique work, its knowledge base, and the interventions you'll find inside, are applicable to any practitioner who provides couple and family therapy—as well as any practitioner who counsels around issues of chronic illness. Couples of Mixed HIV Status provides therapists with a range of theoretical approaches to help mixed HIV status couples deal with their issues and concerns. It includes applications of couple therapy approaches that have proved to be particularly effective as well as case studies that demonstrate how different relationship variables may affect therapy. The book presents the findings of a research study involving 44 mixed HIV status couples in the Northeast and is generously illustrated with tables that make complex research results easy to access and understand. Topics covered in Couples of Mixed HIV Status include: various approaches to couples therapy the historical context of HIV/AIDS HIV transmission family planning and HIV/AIDS emotionally focused couple therapy disclosure issues attachment theory and much more! Couples of Mixed HIV Status: Clinical Issues and Interventions is a valuable resource for therapists and other mental health counselors working with today’s couples of mixed HIV status as well as for students of counseling and health related services. Readers who may be in a mixed HIV status relationship or those who are friends and family members of couples living with HIV will also find this book helpful.",

Instead of focusing on the rating of existing vaccines, this forward-thinking text looks to how new vaccines can be developed and existing ones improved upon. The book provides sound immunological theory and fact as a basis for solving vaccine design problems. Beginning with a discussion of disease and immunity to infection, Designer Vaccines: Principles for Successful Prophylaxis describes how events leading to immunity following infection must be considered in the rational design of vaccines. It also introduces the mucosal immune system and considers the special requirements of oral vaccines. Both viral and bacterial vectors for vaccine delivery are reviewed in detail.",

    "description": "“Essential reading for anyone interested in understanding and treating traumatic stress and the scope of its impact on society.” —Alexander McFarlane, Director of the Centre for Traumatic Stress Studies A pioneering researcher transforms our understanding of trauma and offers a bold new paradigm for healing in this New York Times bestseller Trauma is a fact of life. Veterans and their families deal with the painful aftermath of combat; one in five Americans has been molested; one in four grew up with alcoholics; one in three couples have engaged in physical violence. Dr. Bessel van der Kolk, one of the world’s foremost experts on trauma, has spent over three decades working with survivors. In The Body Keeps the Score, he uses recent scientific advances to show how trauma literally reshapes both body and brain, compromising sufferers’ capacities for pleasure, engagement, self-control, and trust. He explores innovative treatments—from neurofeedback and meditation to sports, drama, and yoga—that offer new paths to recovery by activating the brain’s natural neuroplasticity. Based on Dr. van der Kolk’s own research and that of other leading specialists, The Body Keeps the Score exposes the tremendous power of our relationships both to hurt and to heal—and offers new hope for reclaiming lives.",

    "description": "It is difficult to improve on a classic, but the fifth edition of Psychodynamic Psychiatry in Clinical Practice does just that, offering the updates readers expect with a deft reorganization that integrates DSM-5® with the author's emphasis on psychodynamic thinking. The individual patient is never sacrificed to the diagnostic category, yet clinicians will find the guidance they need to apply DSM-5® appropriately. Each chapter has been systematically updated to reflect the myriad and manifold changes in the 9 years since the previous edition's publication. All 19 chapters have new references and cutting-edge material that will prepare psychiatrists and residents to treat patients with compassion and skill. The book offers the following features: * Each chapter integrates new neurobiological findings with psychodynamic understanding so that clinicians can approach their patients with a truly biopsychosocial treatment plan.* Excellent writing and an intuitive structure make complicated psychodynamic concepts easy to understand so that readers can grasp the practical application of theory in everyday practice.* The book links clinical understanding to the new DSM-5® nomenclature so that clinicians and trainees can adapt psychodynamic thinking to the new conceptual models of disorders.* New coverage of psychodynamic thinking with relation to the treatment of patients on the autism spectrum addresses an increasingly important practice area.* Posttraumatic stress and dissociative disorders have been combined to allow for integrated coverage of primary psychiatric disorders related to trauma and stressors. A boon to clinicians in training and practice, the book has been meticulously edited and grounded in the latest research. The author firmly believes that clinicians must not lose the complexities of the person in the process of helping the patient. Psychodynamic Psychiatry in Clinical Practice, Fifth Edition, keeps this approach front and center as it engages, instructs, and exhorts the reader in the thoughtful, humane practice of psychodynamic psychiatry.",

    "description": "Healthcare providers, consumers, researchers and policy makers are inundated with unmanageable amounts of information, including evidence from healthcare research. It has become impossible for all to have the time and resources to find, appraise and interpret this evidence and incorporate it into healthcare decisions. Cochrane Reviews respond to this challenge by identifying, appraising and synthesizing research-based evidence and presenting it in a standardized format, published in The Cochrane Library (www.thecochranelibrary.com). The Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions contains methodological guidance for the preparation and maintenance of Cochrane intervention reviews. Written in a clear and accessible format, it is the essential manual for all those preparing, maintaining and reading Cochrane reviews. Many of the principles and methods described here are appropriate for systematic reviews applied to other types of research and to systematic reviews of interventions undertaken by others. It is hoped therefore that this book will be invaluable to all those who want to understand the role of systematic reviews, critically appraise published reviews or perform reviews themselves.

La obra se divide en tres partes; la primera comienza introduciendo los conceptos básicos para la evaluación y desarrollo de un programa mediante un método simplificado para la resolución de problemas y describe las técnicas del ejercicio terapéutico. A continuación, en la segunda parte, se analiza la utilización del ejercicio terapéutico, las pautas, precauciones y progresión del plan de asistencia según los casos. Por último, en la tercera parte, se desarrollan los principios y técnicas del ejercicio terapéutico en las áreas especiales de la fisioterapia respiratoria y el ejercicio aeróbico. Esta obra permite al lector elegir las técnicas de ejercicio de acuerdo con los problemas que presenta el paciente y los objetivos del tratamiento. Para ello desarrolla un método integrado que comienza por identificar el problema mediante una evaluación experta para así, poder establecer unas metas realistas basadas en los problemas y poder decidir, por último, un plan de asistencia que cubra los objetivos y necesidades de cada paciente.",

    "description": "Surgery: A Case Based Clinical Review provides the reader with a comprehensive understanding of surgical diseases in one easy to use reference that combines multiple teaching formats. The book begins using a case based approach. The cases presented cover the diseases most commonly encountered on a surgical rotation. The cases are designed to provide the reader with the classic findings on history and physical examination. The case presentation is followed by a series of short questions and answers, designed to provide further understanding of the important aspects of the history, physical examination, differential diagnosis, diagnostic work-up and management, as well as questions that may arise on surgical rounds. Key figures and tables visually reinforce the important elements of the disease process. A brief algorithmic flow chart is provided so the reader can quickly understand the optimal management approach. Two additional special sections further strengthen the student’s comprehension. The first section covers areas of controversy in the diagnosis or management of each disease, and another section discusses pitfalls to avoid, where the inexperienced clinician might get in trouble. The text concludes with a series of multiple choice questions in a surgery shelf/USMLE format with robust explanations. Surgery: A Case Based Clinical Review is based on 20 years of Socratic medical student teaching by a nine-time Golden Apple teaching awardee from the UCLA School of Medicine and will be of great utility for medical students when they rotate on surgery, interns, physician assistant students, nursing students and nurse practitioner students.",
