    "description": "This invaluable volume, the third in the series Air Pollution Reviews, addresses particular questions relating to air pollution and its effect on health, rather than just providing an overall perspective. It deals with the impact of nasal disease on lung exposure, how pollutants are distributed within the lung, and the uncertainties with regard to defining the dose to the lung. It takes a tangential look at the lung dose by exploring the possibility of obtaining clues from occupational medicine. Toxicologically, the book examines the possible methodology for exploring how particles and their toxicity can be investigated, and looks into the cardio-toxic effects of air pollution. The effects of pollutant mixtures are compared with those of separate individual pollutants. In addition, the question of the importance of air acidity is tackled. Epidemiologically, the book deals with the problems associated with point sources as opposed to diffuse sources of air pollution, and considers whether we can quantify the health effects of air pollution adequately. These areas, though difficult, need to be addressed, in order to further develop our knowledge of the health effects of air pollution. In this volume, a strong panel of authors treat the issues. They have raised more questions but at the same time succeeded in solving a number of problems.",

More than thirty years ago, Mr. Kushi recognized that diet was a principal cause of many illnesses, including cancer, and began teaching how the macrobiotic diet, based upon nutritious whole grains, locally grown fresh vegetables, protein-rich beans, and sea vegetables, can prevent health problems and rejuvenate the body. Macrobiotics integrates the latest scientific research in nutrition and health care with the common-sense practices of traditional societies. In this beautifully illustrated edition, Mr. Kushi suggests a more simple way of eating and living, in harmony with vital health and happiness. Macrobiotic foods and cooking methods are described in detail, and a complete exercise program, flexible enough to fit any need, is included. A superb collection of recipes, sample menus, and dozens of suggestions about healthful living make The Macrobiotic Way a truly practical guide.",

Over 27 years of clinical practice, Dr. Wayne has seen a disturbing trend with how demanding or stressful lifestyles can activate the survival mechanism in the brain. When we stay in that zone for an extended period of time, it suppresses critical systems within the body and leaves us open to a cascade of health issues. Written in language that can be understood by patients and practitioners alike, The SD Protocol takes you back to where health starts to spiral out of control. It will show you how seemingly unrelated conditions are actually linked and empower you with simple tools to help you get back in control of your health.",

    "description": "At the height of medical technology and civilization, America has become the fattest and sickest nation to ever grace the earth. There was a time when food was our medicine, and the farmer our physician. But now industrialization has converted farms into factories, replaced produce for processed foods, and meat comes with just as many warnings as the drugs we are prescribed. If we continue to embrace the Standard American Diet (SAD diet) and current health care system, this may be the first generation of parents to outlive their children. The science and medical community are split 50/50 as to why we are so sick. One side is dogmatically attached to the theory that germs cause disease, so sickness is inevitable and can only be treated not cured. The other perspective is that we have a genetic predisposition to disease and that science & technology provide the solution. However, neither of these philosophies actually address the real cause of disease. Vegucation Over Medication bridges the gap by helping us understand the impact of nutrition on our health. Dr. Bobby Price provides actionable advice on how to prevent and even reverse many chronic diseases. The book dispels in shocking detail many of the myths and lies we've adopted as truths, such as the use of medications as our primary form of prevention. Dr. Price's holistic approach to understanding the healing nature of our foods and bodies will empower you to cleanse, nourish, and RECLAIM YOUR HEALTH. In this book you will learn: - Hidden dangers in foods and medicines - How to minimize or eliminate medications - The connection between disease and nutrition - The secrets of long-term natural weight loss - The real scoop on protein - Powerful natural alternatives to help restore the body - Guide to incorporating a plant-based lifestyle - Tasty plant-based alternatives to your favorite foods - How a plant-based diet improves energy, digestion, and sleep - How to reverse Type 2 Diabetes - Keys to normalizing blood pressure and cholesterol levels",

    "description": "The Biology of Belief is a groundbreaking work in the field of New Biology. Author Dr. Bruce Lipton is a former medical school professor and research scientist. His experiments, and that of other leading-edge scientists, have examined in great detail the processes by which cells receive information. The implications of this research radically change our understanding of life. It shows that genes and DNA do not control our biology; that instead DNA is controlled by signals from outside the cell, including the energetic messages emanating from our positive and negative thoughts. Dr. Lipton's profoundly hopeful synthesis of the latest and best research in cell biology and quantum physics is being hailed as a major breakthrough showing that our bodies can be changed as we retrain our thinking.",

    "description": "Feeling great? Feeling lousy? Whatever you're feeling, CRAZY-GOOD LIVING: Healthy Gums, Healthy Gut, Healthy Life can improve your health from the inside out. It's the only book written by a DDS/Medicine Practitioner who has proven the cellular connection between primal eating and health. An ancient diet saved his life after he switched from \"healthy eating\" to eating more like our ancestors. And his supercharged Ancient Nutrition Plan has worked wonders for some of his most severely disease-stricken patients. Lots of books give a few good reasons for returning to a simpler way of eating. More still offer some dietary tips and recipes. NONE has offered all that plus first-hand scientific studies-documented proof for how and why primal nutrition works-and could one day save your life. Written by Periodontist, Certified Primal Health Care Coach, and Certified Functional Medical Practitioner Alvin H. Danenberg, it is destined to become a classic in the field of healthful living.",
