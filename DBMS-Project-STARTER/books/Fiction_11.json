    "description": "A sharp and funny portrait of divorce. Splitting captures brilliantly the chaotic rhythms of a woman in crisis as it chronicles Angelica's disintegration into a handful of a \"perforated\" personalities. No one writes with shrewder insight about women and that ambiguous and overriding presence in their lives-men -- than Fay Weldon. This is a journey rich with her wit, wisdom, and very original narrative power. \"It's always a pleasure to read a seasoned novelist in peak form; Weldon is in complete control of her material here, effortlessly shifting between laughter and tears.\" -- Booklist; \"Splitting is a vintage Weldon brew: sharp, effervescent, easily consumed and just the sort that leaves you ready for another round.\" -- The Hartford Courant; \"A darkly comic portrait of one woman's shattering response to divorce: the latest from an author rightly celebrated for writing witty cautionary tales about the contemporary sexual jungle.\" -- Kirkus Reviews.",

    "description": "\"Rowling's wizardry as a writer is on fulsome display\" (USA Today) in this #1 New York Times bestseller from the international bestselling author Robert Galbraith. When Billy, a troubled young man, comes to private eye Cormoran Strike's office to ask for his help investigating a crime he thinks he witnessed as a child, Strike is left deeply unsettled. While Billy is obviously mentally distressed, and cannot remember many concrete details, there is something sincere about him and his story. But before Strike can question him further, Billy bolts from his office in a panic. Trying to get to the bottom of Billy's story, Strike and Robin Ellacott-once his assistant, now a partner in the agency-set off on a twisting trail that leads them through the backstreets of London, into a secretive inner sanctum within Parliament, and to a beautiful but sinister manor house deep in the countryside. And during this labyrinthine investigation, Strike's own life is far from straightforward: his newfound fame as a private eye means he can no longer operate behind the scenes as he once did. Plus, his relationship with his former assistant is more fraught than it ever has been-Robin is now invaluable to Strike in the business, but their personal relationship is much, much trickier than that. The most epic Robert Galbraith novel yet, Lethal White is both a gripping mystery and a page-turning next instalment in the ongoing story of Cormoran Strike and Robin Ellacott.",

    "description": "Rescued: The Edwards Brothers?Book One tells how Douglas Edwards, a modern man, finds himself awash and adrift in the languid, aqua-blue waters of Molly's long-lashed eyes. In his head, he hears the voices of his parents, counseling him on the traditions of caution and propriety. But, in his present state, laying out careful and deliberate plans seems an ill-fitting response to the vision of the woman who now occupies his waking thoughts. And then there is Jason, his brother, and the complications posed by their overlapping family and business ties. In the pages of Rescued, author Kiki Chalupnik brings to life the first installment in the saga of Jason and Douglas, the Edwards brothers, as they navigate the waters that churn around Molly Beaumont, an employee in their shared business. The entwining of their professional lives and personal feelings lead to moments of suspense, humor, anger, love, and forgiveness. Rescued: The Edwards Brothers?Book One, a contemporary romance, reveals what happens when brothers find themselves drawn to the same woman, work in the same business, and react to the same parental life lessons.",

Wracked by depression and survivor's guilt, all the little vampire wants to do is to crawl back into his wayward mobile coffin and hide from the world until he can find a way to heal his wounds. The timetable for recovery is unclear. The search for his coffin takes him to Strelas, the capital city of Nyobi. A regular stop in his merchant host's travels, the enormous metropolis seems the most logical place to pitch a tent and wait, but there are no guarantees he'll be able to find his coffin in such a large city even when it is there to be found. Not content to leave his fate to the tender mercies of chance, green-haired Rufino barges into the most prestigious tavern in the universe in search of useful information. What he finds instead sets the stage for a whole other game of hide-and-seek-one in which the penalty for failure is death and the prize for winning might also be death!",

Quinn Murphy, however, is not part of that plan. Maddie hasn't seen Quinn since a certain humiliating night fifteen years ago. Now her former crush is running the bar she's inherited, and he's going to fight her for it. And he's not above fighting dirty, apparently. Too bad she can't afford to sell the bar to the lowest bidder—namely, Quinn—and be done with it. Because despite the pain he caused her, the man's irresistibly attractive to her. Always has been. Always, always, will be.",

But there is, as well, even more than ever, a depth of understanding that offers true wisdom to any reader willing to receive it. Joy and sorrow, he seems to say, good living and a capacity to face the darker side of our experience and our existence, combine to make each day magical. These are poems not to be missed.",

    "description": "A dutiful husband and father walks out of his life and into a road trip from hell, in a novel Toni Morrison calls \"Astonishing\" and Don Delillo calls \"A slasher classic . . . strange, dark, and funny.\" Wylie Jones has a happy marriage, beautiful children, backyard barbecues in his tastefully decorated suburban house. One night he follows a sudden impulse, leaves his wife in bed and commandeers his neighbor's emerald-green Ford Galaxy 500, driving away without a second look. He sheds all traces of his old life in favor of a new name and a new life, and drives from town to town, following his deepest impulses where they lead. By turns scathing and hilarious, writing an outrageous rollercoaster of sex and violence, Stephen Wright probes the nihilistic and savage core of the American identity.",

    "description": "\"This book begins where most love stories leave off: at the beginning of real life. The transition from being a young couple in love to a couple of parents is laden with higher expectations than ever before in history, especially for women. Today’s woman expects to be the perfect wife, mother, career woman, self-actualized human being, and homemaker, all while remaining a size six. The idyllic picture that hangs on the wall of our hopes and dreams can’t help but be marred by the ugly scratches of reality, and in this pressure-cooker environment, we’re all too familiar with the resulting divorce statistics. Woman of Valor follows the lives of two women in their first years of motherhood. One is a fictional character trying to live the happily-ever-after life we all imagined for ourselves. The second woman is the author herself, relating her real life story. It’s a story of metamorphosis, from independent working woman to mother, helpless in the face of the discovery that there’s something wrong with her small daughter – something very seriously wrong. Interspersed are actual letters from readers of Lapid’s popular newspaper column about women’s lives, sharing their experiences of juggling their many roles. In trenchant, thoughtful, and often laugh-out-loud funny prose, Lihi Lapid tells a true-life story of women – and men – struggling to live up to modern pressures: a story about shattered dreams, and about finding the strength to gather up the pieces and to learn to smile again.\"",
