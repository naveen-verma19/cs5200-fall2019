    "description": "Der moderne Wirtschaftswissenschaftler hat profunde Kenntnisse der Mathematik. Mit Hilfe mathematischer Methoden werden heute etwa Optionsscheine an der Börse bewertet oder Auktionen entworfen. Zudem bildet die Mathematik die Basis für empirisches Arbeiten mit Hilfe statistischer Methoden. In allen Arbeitsfeldern des Ökonomen ist somit eine gute ökonomische Intuition gepaart mit mathematischem Sachverstand unerlässlich geworden. Im Unterschied zu vielen anderen Lehrbüchern beschränkt sich dieses Buch nicht auf die Besprechung der verschiedenen Methoden und auf ein reines Aufreihen der verschiedenen Regeln und Theoreme. Vielmehr beweisen die Autoren die wichtigsten Aussagen, um dem Leser ein Verständnis für die Richtigkeit mathematischer Aussagen und Beweistechniken zu vermitteln. Des Weiteren werden alle mathematischen Methoden auch an Hand von ökonomischen Beispielen verdeutlicht.",

    "description": "This book presents a selection of multifaceted development issues involving social, economic and environmental aspects, in order to inspire and guide implementation of the United Nations’ SDGs. It focuses on economic development, human well-being and sustainable pathways, with special attention to financial and knowledge resources, as well as measurement concepts. In doing so, the book draws a distinction between sustainability and sustainable pathways by refraining from dealing with broader and more direct environmental sustainability issues like climate change, environmental degradation and sustainable energy. The choice of topics, apart from their relevance for India, was guided by their importance in connection with multiple SDG goals. In addition to revealing the intricacies of systemic relationships and the dilemmas they create in policy choices, the book examines the role of actors and the critical importance of partnerships to help readers comprehend the breadth of diversities and inter-linkages involved. The roles of the central and state governments, the parliament and the state assemblies, the civil society, UN agencies and district-level authorities are separately explored in depth. Sharing valuable insights, the book encourages policymakers, practitioners and scholars to move towards a sustainable and equitable economy, and supports them in their efforts.",

    "description": "Every day we make decisions: about the things that we buy or the meals we eat; about the investments we make or our children's health and education; even the causes that we champion or the planet itself. Unfortunately, we often choose poorly. We are all susceptible to biases that can lead us to make bad decisions that make us poorer, less healthy and less happy. And, as Thaler and Sunstein show, no choice is ever presented to us in a neutral way. By knowing how people think, we can make it easier for them to choose what is best for them, their families and society. Using dozens of eye-opening examples the authors demonstrate how to nudge us in the right directions, without restricting our freedom of choice. Nudge offers a unique new way of looking at the world for individuals and governments alike.This is one of the most engaging, provocative and important books you will ever read.",

    "description": "Upward trending and volatile materials and energy prices, difficult credit conditions and the myriad opportunities of the digital revolution are combining to make a circular economy the key value driver for the coming decades. A New Dynamic makes the contemporary case for a profound shift from throughput to 'roundput', from ownership to access. The circular economy is enabled by disruptive information technology and the design of materials and products to flow in effective cycles and at high quality - 'made to be made again'. The size of the prize is in the billions of dollars of materials cost savings per year. A New Dynamic features some of the leading writers and practitioners in the field including Walter Stahel, Michael Braungart, Amory Lovins and Chris Tuppen. The volume contains contributions on understanding the model, business case studies, the performance economy, history and development and the entrepreneurial opportunities of these fluid times. This book is a mandated reader for the MBA in Innovation, Enterprise and the Circular Economy at Bradford University School of Management.",

In addition to a thorough analysis of the contemporary economic landscape in Australia -- with updated statistics, figures, and political and business developments -- the second edition provides useful international comparisons with economies in Asia and Europe, as well as that of the United States. The adapting Australian author team has contextualised the content to suit the needs of Australian university students. Key introductory microeconomic and macroeconomics concepts are explained using the latest theory and research, with data relevant to the Australian economy. Throughout the text, these concepts are applied to contemporary local economic issues for businesses and individuals, such as: * the Australian dollar * the mining industry * the National Broadband Network * petrol prices * privatisation * the banking and finance sectors * the automotive industry * the carbon tax * the ageing population * skills shortages * international trade. At an expanded 18 chapters for the second edition, this textbook is an ideal resource for a one?semester university course in introductory economics.",

    "description": "This important new work reflects on the contemporary human condition in a 'posthuman' and 'machinistic' world, almost overwhelmed by security concerns, terror and its politics, and technoscience.Exploring the role of human rights and development in such a world, Baxi contends that any serious analysis of human rights theory and practice must confront two critical realities. Firstly, that the new world economic and military orders, along with the continuing wars of and on 'terror', adverselyimpact global social and human development policies and programmes. Secondly, that emergent technologies, especially artificial intelligence, biotechnologies, and nano-technologies, generating the discourse of the posthuman, have serious implications for human rights. The book presents a critique of the approaches towards a theory of human rights proposed by Amartya Sen and his emphasis on the ethical, as opposed to the juridical nature of such rights. It proceeds to examine the complexities and contradictions of the ideology of development, and asks why therehas been so little progress with regard to the right to development. It explores how in the current world scenario the 'emancipatory potential' of human rights may be carried forward in theoretical work and through activism.",

    "publishedDate": "2000",
    "description": "In his foreword, Robert D. Tollison identifies the main objective of Geoffrey Brennan and James M. Buchanan’s The Reason of Rules: \". . . a book-length attempt to focus the energies of economists and other social analysts on the nature and function of the rules under which ordinary political life and market life function.” In persuasive style, Brennan and Buchanan argue that too often economists become mired in explaining the obvious or constructing elaborate mathematical models to shed light on trivial phenomena. Their solution: economics as a discipline would be better focused on deriving normative procedures for establishing rules so that ordinary economic life can proceed unaffected as much as possible by social issues. In The Reason of Rules, Brennan and Buchanan sketch out a methodological and analytical framework for the establishment of rules. They point out that the consideration of rules has its roots in classical economics and has been hinted at in the work of some contemporary economists. But the enterprise of applying the analytical rigor of modern economics to the establishment of effective rules is the little-traveled road that bears the most promise. In fact, the basic idea of the importance of rules is a thread that runs through virtually the whole of Buchanan’s distinguished career, and it is one of his signal contributions to the contemporary discipline of economics.

Focusing on various aspects of the development and application of indicators derived from data on scholarly publications, patents and electronic communications, the individual chapters, written by leading experts, discuss theoretical and methodological issues, illustrate applications, highlight their policy context and relevance, and point to future research directions. A substantial portion of the book is dedicated to detailed descriptions and analyses of data sources, presenting both traditional and advanced approaches. It addresses the main bibliographic metrics and indexes, such as the journal impact factor and the h-index, as well as altmetric and webometric indicators and science mapping techniques on different levels of aggregation and in the context of their value for the assessment of research performance as well as their impact on research policy and society. It also presents and critically discusses various national research evaluation systems. Complementing the sections reflecting on the science system, the technology section includes multiple chapters that explain different aspects of patent statistics, patent classification and database search methods to retrieve patent-related information. In addition, it examines the relevance of trademarks and standards as additional technological indicators. The Springer Handbook of Science and Technology Indicators is an invaluable resource for practitioners, scientists and policy makers wanting a systematic and thorough analysis of the potential and limitations of the various approaches to assess research and research performance.",

    "description": "From one of the most important economic thinkers of our time, a brilliant and far-seeing analysis of the current populist backlash against globalization. In The Third Pillar, economist Raghuram Rajan offers up a magnificent big-picture framework for understanding how the economy, society, and the state interact, why things begin to break down, and how we can find our way back to a more secure and stable plane. The 'third pillar' of the title is society; economists all too often understand their field as the relationship between the market and government, and they leave squishy social issues for other people. As Rajan argues, that's not just myopic; it's dangerous. All economics is actually socioeconomics - all markets are embedded in a web of human relations, values and norms. He demonstrates how, throughout history, technological phase shifts have ripped the market out of those old webs and led to violent backlashes, and to what we now call populism. Eventually, a new equilibrium is reached, but it can be ugly and messy, especially if done wrong. And right now, we are doing it wrong. As markets scale up, government scales up with it, concentrating economic and political power in flourishing central hubs and leaving the periphery to decompose, figuratively and even literally. Instead, Rajan offers a way to rethink the relationship between the market and civil society and argues for a return to strengthening and empowering local communities as an antidote to growing despair and unrest. Rajan is not a doctrinaire conservative, so his ultimate argument that decision-making has to be watered at the grass roots or our democracy will continue to wither, is sure to be provocative. But even setting aside its solutions, The Third Pillar is a masterpiece of explication, a book that will be a classic of its kind for its offering of a wise, authoritative and humane explanation of the forces that have wrought such a sea change in our lives.",

    "description": "'Who's Who in Economics is indispensable for any library and department of economics, as well as for individual scholars playing an active role in the academic community. No other source presents so many facts on the leading economists as conveniently and reliably. . . . Blaug's volume is not only an outstanding source of information on individual economists, but it also provides a rich database for research on the economics profession. Thus, several academic articles systematically analysed the second edition, and Blaug explicitly invites research based on the third edition.' - Bruno S. Frey and Reiner Eichenberger, Kyklos '. . . valuable reference book. . . . Such an inviting book. . . . Thumbing through the entries in Who's Who in Economics does give a unique insight into the concerns and findings of the world's leading economists. . .' - Robert Whaples, EH.Net This major reference work has been thoroughly revised, updated and extended for the third edition. It is the only biographical dictionary of major economists to appear in any language. As an extensive and authoritative guide to economists both past and present who have made a substantial contribution to the subject, it provides biographical, bibliographical and critical information on over one thousand living economists and some five hundred deceased economists.",

    "description": "This book focuses on wealth inequality trends in the North Atlantic Anglo-sphere countries of Canada, the United Kingdom, and the United States over the period from 1668 to 2013: a wider perspective than generally used when wealth inequality is discussed. This book demonstrates that it is important to put current dimensions of wealth inequality into historical context by looking at performance over the long run rather than simply a few decades. Moreover, this contribution compiles a substantial amount of data on estimates of wealth inequality and provides a concise overview of trends as well as the drivers of inequality over the long term. It serves as a short supplementary text for economics and sociology courses on economic inequality, economic history and social change—while remaining of interest to scholars and policymakers invested in equality debates of the past and present.",

    "description": "'Beginning with the nature of Scholastic and Mercantilistic economic thought, the text takes us through the institutional changes and the conceptual developments they fostered over the next four centuries. the expository plan is easy to follow, since it follows the historical timeline and stops to describe various institutional changes brought on by the growth of the European economies. This book should have a ready market. . . . the easy exposition and the portrayal of the historical developments make this useful supplementary reading; with a text of original writings, it could serve as a good introductory text in the history of finance. the reproductions of several pages of original text provide the text with an authentic flavor. In most places, the book has much fun stuff to read.' - Salim Rashid, EH.Net 'Poitras ably combines an intellectual history of financial economics with a history of financial markets and instruments. His history of the development of financial markets offers new insights into their economic function and operations and, while financial economics had always had an applied interest that has often been lacking in mainstream economics, he shows that significant early contributions were made by such distinguished mathematicians as Halley, de Moivre and Bachelier. This book will be valuable to financial economists with an interest in the intellectual and institutional antecedents of their field.' - Michael J. Brennan, University of California, Los Angeles, US Despite being an integral part of modern economic science, the subject of financial economics has deep historical roots. Geoffrey Poitras provides an exhaustive account of the early development of the subject and, in so doing, provides a sound basis for the study of modern financial economics. By the time the Wealth of Nations had appeared, financial economics featured a well developed body of scientific knowledge, covering subjects such as fixed income evaluation, life insurance and derivative securities. from beginnings which are traced back to the commercial arithmetic of the Renaissance reckoning schools, by the latter part of the 18th century financial economics had witnessed contributions by the likes of Abraham de Moivre, Edmond Halley and Simon Stevin. This book chronicles the development of early financial economics, from the appearance of the first printed commercial arithmetic in 1478 to the publication of the Wealth of Nations in 1776.",

    "description": "KEY BENEFIT: This book introduces the philosophy of economic justice while presenting a non-dogmatic defense of the welfare state. It presents and describes libertarian capitalism, state socialism, and the welfare state with the purpose of determining which best satisfies the requirements of economic justice. Each system is then evaluated from the perspective of three widely recognized values: promoting human well-being, giving people what they deserve, and promoting human liberty. Though the book defends a particular position, it is also written to encourage readers to think about the issues intelligently and form their own educated views on the subject. Written in a clear and readable style, Economic Justice explains the central ideas on the nature of capitalism, socialism, and the welfare state while providing concise discussions of the major theorists: Marx, Nozick, and Rawls. An important and valuable book for any reader interested in understanding and evaluating the current debates and issues of economic justice as they relate to capitalism and the welfare state.",

    "description": "This book explores how African countries can convert their natural resources, particularly oil and gas, into sustainable development assets. Using Ghana, one of the continent’s newest oil-producing countries, as a lens, it examines the \"resource curse\" faced by other producers - such as Nigeria, Angola, and Equatorial Guinea - and demonstrates how mismanagement in those countries can provide valuable lessons for new oil producers in Africa and elsewhere. Relying on a broad range of fieldwork and policymaking experience, Panford suggests practical measures for resource-rich developing countries to transform natural resources into valuable assets that can help create jobs, boost human resources, and improve living and working conditions in Ghana in particular. He suggests fiscal, legal, and environmental antidotes to resource mismanagement, which he identifies as the major obstacle to socioeconomic development in countries that have historically relied on natural resources.",

    "description": "We've long suspected that we live in a small world, where everything is connected to everything else. Indeed, networks are pervasive--from the human brain to the Internet to the economy to our group of friends. These linkages, it turns out, aren't random. All networks, to the great surprise of scientists, have an underlying order and follow simple laws. Understanding the structure and behavior of these networks will help us do some amazing things, from designing the optimal organization of a firm to stopping a disease outbreak before it spreads catastrophically. In Linked, Barabási, a physicist whose work has revolutionized the study of networks, traces the development of this rapidly unfolding science and introduces us to the scientists carrying out this pioneering work. These \"new cartographers\" are mapping networks in a wide range of scientific disciplines, proving that social networks, corporations, and cells are more similar than they are different, and providing important new insights into the interconnected world around us. This knowledge, says Barabási, can shed light on the robustness of the Internet, the spread of fads and viruses, even the future of democracy.",

    "description": "Have you ever wondered why we can afford to buy far more clothes than our grandparents ever could ... but may be less likely to own a home in which to keep them all? Why your petrol bill can double in a matter of months, but it never falls as fast?; Behind all of this lies economics.; It's not always easy to grasp the complex forces that are shaping our lives. But by following a dollar on its journey around the globe, we can start to piece it all together.; The dollar is the lifeblood of globalisation. Greenbacks, singles, bucks or dead presidents: call them what you will, they are keeping the global economy going. Half of the notes in circulation are actually outside of the USA - and many of the world's dollars are owned by China.; But what is really happening as our cash moves around the world every day, and how does it affect our lives? By following one dollar from a shopping trip in suburban Texas, via China's central bank, Nigerian railroads, the oilfields of Iraq and beyond, The Almighty Dollar reveals the economic truths behind what we see on the news every day. Why is China the world's biggest manufacturer - and the USA its biggest customer? Is free trade really a good thing? Why would a nation build a bridge on the other side of the planet?; In this illuminating read, economist Dharshini David lays bare these complex relationships to get to the heart of how our new globalised world works, showing who really holds the power, and what that means for us all.",

    "description": "International Edition Engaging and provocative writing, as well as a knack for revealing the 'invisible hand' of economics at work has made Tyler Cowen and Alex Tabarrok’s text a singularly distinctive and effective text for principles modules. Modern Principles of Macroeconomics places an emphasis throughout on the power of incentives which underscores how economics helps us understand why we do what we do (in other words, the decisions we make in the face of incentives in the real world). The new edition retains its progressive approach to economic modelling and applications which allows for a more realistic interpretation of today’s world events. Mirroring the authors’ successful blog, the text eschews boxed features to focus on the writing behind compelling examples, key concepts, and applications.",

    "description": "Most people who live in the United States have heard the media and the U.S. Government demonize Cuba, its leaders, and its system. However, have you ever wanted to know what Cuba is really like? If the U.S. media and government have been guilty of fabricating other misconceptions and covering up covert operations in order to deceive the American public, could it be possible that Cuba is another such case? Why would the U.S. continue disseminating Cold War rhetoric about a tiny island nation like Cuba? Who is benefiting from perpetuating a decades-old economic embargo against a country with few allies and fewer resources? Americans tend to see this island jewel as either \"forbidden fruit\" or as the communist devil dwelling in our own back yard. But ever since the U.S. imposed the Trade Embargo on Cuba in 1962, it has been nearly impossible for American citizens to visit Cuba legally and come to their own conclusions. Author Jason Old decided that listening to the media and US Government about Cuba wasn't enough, and instead decided to embark on his own life-changing trip to Cuba to see for himself what the real Cuba was like behind the embargo. Join Jason on his travels across Cuba to get a better sense of the Cuban socialist system, the country's history, its people, and the culture that make this controversial Caribbean country so inspiring for some, yet so despised by others.",

    "description": "Communism as a political movement attained global importance after the Bolsheviks toppled the Russian Czar in 1917. After that time the works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels, especially the influential Communist Manifesto (1848), enjoyed an international audience. The world was to learn a new political vocabulary peppered with \"socialism,\" \"capitalism,\" \"the working class,\" \"the bourgeoisie,\" \"labor theory of value,\" \"alienation,\" \"economic determinism,\" \"dialectical materialism,\" and \"historical materialism.\" Marx's economic analysis of history has been a powerful legacy, the effects of which continue to be felt world-wide. Serving as the foundation for Marx's indictment of capitalism is his extraordinary work titled Economic and Philosophic Manuscripts, written in 1844 but published nearly a century later. Here Marx offers his theory of human nature and an analysis of emerging capitalism's degenerative impact on man's sense of self and his creative potential. What is man's true nature? How did capitalism gain such a foothold on Western society? What is alienation and how does it threaten to undermine the proletariat? These and other vital questions are addressed as the youthful Marx sets forth his first detailed assessment of the human condition.",
