    "description": "Mark Watson doesn't take much notice of the news when the head of Berkeley Square Cosmetics is gruesomely attacked in London. Mark has just been wooed to LA to be groomed as the new singing partner to the rock star, Isis. Still not totally believing his good luck he allows himself to be 'made over' - new wardrobe, new hair style, new name - until he's not too sure who he really is. Even when he learns that he and Isis have a multi-million dollar endorsement deal with Berkeley Square, Mark doesn't make the connection between the violence in London and his new role. Then someone targets them in a bomb attack and Mark wakes up with a jolt. Unable to fathom Isis's over-hysterical reaction, Mark determines not only to survive with his life and his career intact, but also to discover who the real Isis is and why she should be so vulnerable to threats. It's a path which leads him into chilling danger and which makes him wish he'd never entertained an ambition to be famous. Visit the author's website at www.davidmichie.com",

    "publisher": "Pushkin PressLtd",

    "description": "The New Adventures of Sinbad the Sailor by gifted young Algerian novelist Salim Bachi is the story of a modern-day Odysseus, living and loving his away across Europe with a sceptical eye and a cynical tongue: a truly original take on the Thousand and One Nights, and every bit as sexy. I knew every promontory, every valley and every hill in this realm of pleasures and exotic fragrances...She oozed a delicate, heavy liquor. Her skin smelled of jasmine in the morning and amber at night. Her parted thighs opened into a welcoming darkness redolent of the lingering smell of damp grass. Salim Bachi's Sinbad is also an Arab, and a buccaneering one at that. In the guise of a hawker of unconsidered trifles - everything from multi-coloured handkerchiefs to Moroccan slippers (made in China...) - he sails from Algeria as an illegal immigrant to southern Europe. So begins his romping satire on 21st century western politics and social mores. Watching Italian television was like abandoning all hope, the way Dante had before the gates of his Inferno, he comments when in Rome, deriding TV as ancient games updated for modern tastes: ... instead of Christians providing the entertainment, a collection of poor sods paraded their private lives before millions of spectators. In between bloody sparring matches, young ladies, who were half-naked and preferably blonde, strutted around and commented....in shocked, strident tones. From the Sorbonne to the Villa Medici, from Messina to Madrid, Sinbad dissects the glitz and the grime of European culture, philosophising all the while from the bed of his latest conquest, always beautiful, always friendly and always yielding. But this book is much more than just a travelogue of sexual conquest: there is irony, trenchant criticism and deep insight into what makes both Western and Arab societies tick. Salim Bachi (b. 1971) is one of the most remarkable new voices of North Africa writing in French. He was born in Algeria and studied literature in Paris and now lives in France. His first book Le Chien d Ulysse (2001) was awarded the Goncourt du Premier Roman; his fourth book, Le Silence de Mahomet (2008), a fictionalised biography of the prophet Mohammed, was shortlisted for the Prix Goncourt and the Prix Renaudot. The Silence of Mohammed was published in English by Pushkin Press in 2010.",

In a stunning display of imagination he weaves together a history that takes him from the war-torn Ethiopia of his parents' youth to a brighter vision of his own life in contemporary America, a story - real or invented- that holds the possibility of reconciliation and redemption.

    "description": "Biyi Bandele's striking novel, The Street, is inhabited by eccentric, mesmerizing characters, who, according to the unnamed narrator, are 'people reaching out to one another, searching for love'.This multiracial neighbourhood witnesses Mide the bookseller, moonlighting as a stand-up comedian; Haifa Kampana, infatuated with the cashier at the 7-eleven; and the Heckler, deriding the sandwich-board preachers outside Brixton tube station.Through these characters, Biyi Bandele creates a surreal social milieu in which he positions the restored relationship between the painter, Nehushta, and her father, Ossie Jones, who has awakened from a fifteen-year coma. Bandele's blend of humour, sentimentality and the fantastic is an invigorating literary exploration of diasporic reality in contemporary Britain.",

    "description": "In the East African Kwatee Republic of the 1990s, the dictatorship is about to fall, and the nation’s exiles are preparing to return. One of these exiles, a young man named Kalumba, is a graduate student in the United States, where he encounters Mrs. Shaw, a professor emerita and former British settler who fled Kwatee’s postcolonial political and social turmoil. Kalumba’s girlfriend, too, is an exile: a Puerto Rican nationalist like her imprisoned father, she is an outcast from the island. Brought together by a history of violence and betrayals, all three are seeking a way of regaining their humanity, connecting with each other, and learning to make a life in a new land. Kalumba and Mrs. Shaw, in particular, are linked by a past rooted in colonial and postcolonial oppression, yet they are separated by their differing accounts of what really happened. The memory of each is subject to certain lapses, whether selective or genuine. Even when they agree on the facts--be they acts of love, of betrayal, or of violence--each narrator shapes the story in his own way, by what is left in and what is left out, by what is remembered and what is forgotten.",

Then comes an outlandish order: steal a piece of the moon. With both personal and national glory at stake, Wale manages to pull off the near impossible, setting out on a journey back to Nigeria that leads anywhere but home. Compelled by Wale’s impulsive act, Nigerians traces arcs in time and space from Houston to Stockholm, from Cape Town to Bulawayo, picking up on the intersecting lives of a South African abalone smuggler, a freedom fighter’s young daughter, and Wale’s own ambitious son.

    "description": "Award-winning Michiel Heyns returns with a richly textured novel set in contemporary South Africa. The murder of a beautiful woman shatters the rural village peace of Alfredville, and her husband, the police station commander, is jailed as chief suspect. Her cousin Peter, a freelance writer in London, returns to South Africa for the first time in decades -- unsettled, curious, but also in search of a career-defining story. On checking into the Queen's Hotel he finds that things are not as straightforward as he imagined, and South Africa is not as he left it. His carefully ordered world is thrown into turmoil as his trip dredges up a long-abandoned past, forcing him to question the assumptions so easily held from the comfort of his London flat. He meets a mixture of locals, visitors, vagrants and migrants, but most momentously, Peter discovers that his bosom friend from school, Bennie Nienaber, is still in Alfredville -- and is in fact now, acting station commander at the local police station. Peter re-establishes an awkward friendship with his erstwhile friend and the two warily circle each other, sharing reminiscences that hint at a bond much deeper than nostalgia. As Peter abandons the neatly patterned story he had planned and is forced to participate in a community that he once despised, he begins to reconsider his place in the world. In search of Desirée's story, he now starts to rewrite his own -- till events take an even more shocking turn. . . This book explores questions of xenophobia and prejudice, of national, sexual and personal identity, and what it means to be a foreigner wherever you go.",

But he doesn't have long to celebrate, because his new boss is transferring him from Accra, Ghana's capital, out to remote Obuasi, in the Ashanti region, an area now notorious for the illegal exploitation of its gold mines. The assignment will last at least a year, meaning Dawson has the unpleasant choice of uprooting his entire family or making do without them. Worst of all, when Dawson arrives at the Obusai headquarters, he finds it in complete disarray. The office is a mess of uncatalogued evidence and cold case files, morale is low, and discipline among officers is lax. Dawson is beginning to see how much work is cut out for him when he sets out to investigate his first homicide case, on only his second day on the job. A body has been unearthed in one of the gold quarries--the man who owned the mine, a Chinese immigrant named Bao Liu, one of many who have flocked to the Ashanti region to work the alluvial gold mines. The list of potential suspects is a long one, and Dawson must pursue it alone, because he can't trust his sergeant partner. He learns very quickly how dangerous it is to pursue justice in this kingdom of illegal gold mines, where the worst offenders have so much money they have no fear of the law\"--",

    "description": "This is the story of a hero. Ten-year-old Robert knows many things. He knows all about his hometown, Geneva, with its statues and cannons and underground tunnels and the Longest Bench in the World. He knows about the Red Cross and all the places his dad has been on his missions. He knows that his mum is writing a book about vampires and how long his older brother spends practicing his 'swag' poses in front of the mirror. He knows all about animals, too, because his Auntie Delphia is a vet in Zimbabwe. But still he has questions. Is his neighbour, Monsieur Renoir, really evil? Why did he leave a Victoria Cross medal on Robert's doorstep? And why has Auntie Delphia disappeared? In the 'Peace and Conflict' unit in school, Robert learned all about wars and heroes. But as the lives of his friends, foes and family unfold, he discovers what it really means to be a hero . . .",

Following a deadly plague, America has split into two civilizations: Elysium on the east coast and Freeland on the west, with a vast continent made up of a Wilderness and a radioactive Toxic Zone between them. In this sequal to Winged Isis, Tomyris Whitaker, the leader of Isis, and her wing woman Danu Sullivan, have chased two Elysian jets across the Border and into the land inhabited by Freeland's mortal enemy, the Elysium Regulators. Following the crash landing of their aircraft, the Freelanders are cast adrift in a civilization that has regressed almost four hundred years. Elysium has become a feudal empire of politically powerful clerics, landholders and serfs. A land of king-like Procurators where strong-minded women are condemned as witches and burned at the stake. Whit and Danu fall in with a band of Amazon rebels as they fight for survival. Meanwhile in Freeland, Kali and Tor grow impatient with procedural delays and mount their own rescue mission to save Whit and Danu. As the four Freelanders grow more determined than ever to be reunited, Kali's rescue mission goes",

They mine during the day in and, as soon as night falls, they abandon themselves in Tram 83, the city's only nightclub. Lucien, a writer, fleeing censorship, finds refuge there with his friend, Requiem, a thief. Tram 83 plunges the reader into the atmosphere of a gold rush as cynical as it is comic and colourfully exotic. It's an observation of human relationships in a world that has become a global village.",

She is a prideful woman who joined her order to escape the shame of being left at the altar, though she didn't really want to be married anyway. Katherine finds great relief in escaping the cold Victorian Ireland of 1872.Catriona Pelham is a member of the reasonably affluent farming gentry. Her relationship with the hardworking townspeople and its farmers is one of genuine and mutual respect. The town's wealthy, however, have ostracized her due to her unorthodox ways and refusal to conform to society's expectations of a woman of the 1870's. As their bond develops, the journey begins for these two strong-willed women. For Katherine it is a journey of self-discovery and of what life holds outside the cloistered walls of the convent. For Catriona it is bittersweet, as feelings she has kept hidden for years resurface in her growing interest in Katherine.",

The reaches opened before us and closed behind, as if the forest had stepped leisurely across the water to bar the way for our return. We penetrated deeper and deeper into the heart of darkness. At the peak of European Imperialism, steamboat captain Charles Marlow travels deep into the African Congo on his way to relieve the elusive Mr Kurtz, an ivory trader renowned for his fearsome reputation. On his journey into the unknown Marlow takes a terrifying trip into his own subconscious, overwhelmed by his menacing, perilous and horrifying surroundings. The landscape and the people he meets force him to reflect on human nature and society, and in turn Conrad writes revealingly about the dangers of imperialism. \"",

    "description": "The plants were pushing the houses back, each millimetre of growth adding to each tendril a new triumph of organic force. 'We're just starting summer rains, right?' Babalwa asked rhetorically. 'It's October, right? And it rains hard up here?' We were driving through the matchbox houses of Katlehong. 'Very.' 'What you reckon - two years? Three? Before everything is gone?' Dub Steps has a strange long aftertaste. It is science fiction with ordinary characters trying to understand what it is to be alive. People have gone, suddenly, inexplicably, and the remaining handful have to find each other and start again. Nature comes back, Johannesburg becomes wonderfully overgrown, designer pigs watch from the periphery walls, and the small group of survivors have to find ways of living with their own flaws and the flaws of each other. There are no clichés in this book, but there is plenty of humor, originality and a gripping, unusual interrogation of the ordinary but really extraordinary fact of being alive.",

    "description": "Marie, a nurse on the island of Mayotte, adopts an abandoned baby and names him Moïse, raising him as a French boy. As he grows up, Moïse struggles with his status as an \"outsider\" and to understand why he was abandoned as a baby. When Marie dies, he is left alone, plunged into uncertainty and turmoil, ending up in the largest and most infamous slum on Mayotte, nicknamed \"Gaza\". Narrated by five different characters, Tropic of Violence is an exploration of lost youth on the French island of Mayotte in the Indian Ocean. Shining a powerful light on problems of violence, immigration, identity, deprivation and isolation on this island that became a French département in 2011, it is a remarkable, unsettling new novel that draws on the author's own observations from her time on Mayotte.",

After the death of the foster mother who raised her, Rose finds herself in possession of a boxful of mysterious artifacts that present baffling links to her heritage. This marks the beginning of a journey of self-discovery in search of her true identity. Her quest takes her to the quaint village of Oberon, situated amid the majestic splendor - and conflicted history - of the uKhahlamba Drakensberg, where the descendants of the last surviving San community are said to reside. There, she uncovers unexpected revelations that propel her towards a new and deeper understanding of herself, her ancestral roots, and a more integrated sense of place and belonging on African soil. This perceptive novel encapsulates the identity dilemmas of young, white South Africans amid the fluctuating social and political scenarios of South Africa. Weaving through it is the disorientation of a white tribe lost in transition between old and new social orders.",

In the chaotic megacity of Kinshasa, the educated but unemployed young man must navigate the ever widening distance between tradition and modernity -- from the payment of his fiancee's exorbitant dowry to the unexpected sexual confession of his best friend -- as he struggles with responsibility and flirts with temptation. The first novel to be translated into English from Lingala, Mr. Fix It introduces major new talent Richard Ali A Mutu, who leads a new generation of writers whose work portrays the everyday realities of Congolese life with the bold, intense style associated with the country's music and fashion.",

    "description": "In Land and Blood, his second novel, the Algerian-Kabyle writer Mouloud Feraoun offers a detailed portrait of life for Algerian Kabyles in the 1920s and 1930s through the story of a Kabyle-Berber man, Amer. Like many Kabyle men of the 1930s, Amer leaves his village to work in the coal mines of France. While in France, he inadvertently kills his own uncle in an accident that sets in motion forces of betrayal and revenge once he returns home. Unlike The Poor Man’s Son, his first fictional work, Land and Blood is not autobiographical but is rather the first in a series of novels Feraoun planned to write about immigrant ties between France and Algeria in the years leading up to World War II. Through Amer’s story, Feraoun unveils what daily life was like in a poor village of colonial-era Algeria. Published in 1953, a year before the outbreak of the Algerian War, Land and Blood provides a fascinating account of Muslim, Berber-Arab social, cultural, and religious practices of rural Algeria in the pre-independence era.",

    "description": "In an unnamed African nation, the people are subject to a state of perpetual warfare and to an Orwellian abuse of language that strips from language its meaning and renders life senseless. And in a bare room lit only by moonlight, a young man hides, waiting for the mysterious crocodile-men to come and help him escape from the violent tyranny of the state. While he waits, he tells his story. This is Kossi Efoui's catastrophic and carnivalesque dreamscape, the dark setting of The Shadow of Things to Come. Here, men and women are taken in the night, spirited away from their families and sent to plantation penal colonies to be worked to the edge of madness. When they return, they are empty shells, their lost time referred to as the \"Time of Annexation.\" But though his parents were taken, our protagonist survived, first in the care of a quirky benefactress named Mama Maize, then under the wing of the state itself, as a student at one of its elite schools. When he meets a bookseller named Axis Kemal, however, he has found a surrogate father, an eccentric and wise man who can bring him out of the meaningless confusion and tell him the truth about the society he lives in. Through his characters, Efoui speaks out against atrocity and the abuse of power, but more, he writes against political rhetoric and the destruction of meaning by government. This novel is a love letter to language and, in Chris Turner's dazzling translation, it becomes a stunning introduction for English-language readers to an exciting new talent.",

If it's a fishing accident then is it a photography accident when a second corpse is discovered at a remote lake and is wearing nothing but her underwear? Ranger McIntyre's usual duties as a park ranger do not include murder--or women in underwear, for that matter--but he keeps on putting pieces of the puzzle together until they lead him to a backcountry hut and a murderer who orders him to disrobe. At gunpoint. Ranger McIntyre is also drawn into an FBI investigation. The suspect is selling salacious photographs of nudes who appear to be very, very dead. McIntyre's interaction with the FBI agent is made even more embarrassing by the fact that the agent's secretary is the \"dead\" gorgeous Violet Coteau, who looks like a flapper, shoots like Annie Oakley and drives like Barney Oldfield.",

This study makes the case that Forna's works delve into the historical and political landscapes of Sierra Leone and trace the growth and development of the nation from the pre-colonial to post-independence era. Within this trajectory she engages the legacies of colonialism, post-independence betrayal and disillusionment, political instability, violence and oppression leading to the civil wars of the '90s.",

    "description": "A provocative debut novel by a brilliant young Nigerian writer, tackling politics, class, spirituality, and power as a group of friends come of age in Lagos Growing up in middle-class Lagos, Nigeria during the late 1980s and early 1990s, Ihechi forms a band of close friends discovering Lagos together as teenagers with differing opinions of everything from film to football, Fela Kuti to spirituality, sex to politics. They remain close-knit until tragedy unfolds during an anti-government riot. Exiled from Lagos by his concerned mother, Ihechi moves in with his uncle's family, where he struggles to find himself outside his former circle of friends. Ihechi eventually finds success by leveraging his connection with a notorious prostitution linchpin and political heavyweight, earning favor among the ruling elite. But just as Ihechi is about to make his final ascent into the elite political class, he reunites with his childhood friends and experiences a crisis of conscience that forces him to question his world, his motives, and whom he should become. Nnamdi Ehirim's debut novel,Prince of Monkeys, is a lyrical, meditative observation of Nigerian life, religion, and politics at the end of the twentieth century.",
