    "description": "For the practicing neuropsychologist or researcher, keeping up with the sheer number of newly published or updated tests is a challenge, as is evaluating the utility and psychometric properties of neuropsychological tests in a clinical context. The goal of the third edition of A Compendium of Neuropsychological Tests, a well-established neuropsychology reference text, is twofold. First, the Compendium is intended to serve as a guidebook that provides a comprehensive overview of the essential aspects of neuropsychological assessment practice. Second, it is intended as a comprehensive sourcebook of critical reviews of major neuropsychological assessment tools for the use by practicing clinicians and researchers. Written in a comprehensive, easy-to-read reference format, and based on exhaustive review of research literature in neuropsychology, neurology, psychology, and related disciplines, the book covers topics such as basic aspects of neuropsychological assessment as well as the theoretical background, norms, and the utility, reliability, and validity of neuropsychological tests. For this third edition, all chapters have been extensively revised and updated. The text has been considerably expanded to provide a comprehensive yet practical overview of the state of the field. Two new chapters have been added: \"Psychometrics in Neuropsychological Assessment\" and \"Norms in Psychological Assessment.\" The first two chapters present basic psychometric concepts and principles. Chapters three and four consider practical aspects of the history-taking interview and the assessment process itself. Chapter five provides guidelines on report-writing and chapters six through sixteen consist of detailed, critical reviews of neuropsychological tests, and address the topics of intelligence, achievement, executive function, attention, memory, language, visual perception, somatosensory olfactory function, mood/personality, and response bias. A unique feature is the inclusion of tables that summarize salient features of tests within each domain so that readers can easily compare measures. Additional tables within each test review summarize important features of each test, highlight aspects of each normative dataset, and provide an overview of psychometric properties. Of interest to neuropsychologists, neurologists, psychiatrists, and educational and clinical psychologists working with adults as well as pediatric populations, this volume will aid practitioners in selecting appropriate testing measures for their patients, and will provide them with the knowledge needed to make empirically supported interpretations of test results.",

    "description": "We have built a world that no longer fits our bodies. Our genes - selected through our evolution - and the many processes by which our development is tuned within the womb, limit our capacity to adapt to the modern urban lifestyle. There is a mismatch. We are seeing the impact of this mismatch in the explosion of diabetes, heart disease and obesity. But it also has consequences in earlier puberty and old age. Bringing together the latest scientific research in evolutionary biology, development, medicine, anthropology and ecology, Peter Gluckman and Mark Hanson, both leading medical scientists, argue that many of our problems as modern-day humans can be understood in terms of this fundamental and growing mismatch. It is an insight that we ignore at our peril.",

    "description": "This volume argues the case that public health communication has affected health behavior. It brings together 16 studies of large-scale communication in a variety of substantive health areas--tobacco, drugs, AIDS, family planning, heart disease, childhood disease, highway safety--prepared by the authors who did the original research. These studies show important effects and illustrate the central conditions for success. The book also includes complementary analytic chapters which provide a meta-analysis of published results, some approaches to developing communication interventions, and alternative methods for evaluation of public health communication projects. Including studies based on communication programs in the United States, as well as projects done elsewhere in the world, including Europe, Africa, Asia and Latin America, this book: *offers a broad presentation of the alternative research designs that have been used to evaluate public health communication programs; *includes a great range of approaches from field experiments and natural experiments to simple before-after and complex time series designs, using data gathered from individuals and from archives; and *utilizes an innovative perspective on how to exercise public health communication from a leading and thoughtful practitioner. As such, it is required reading for scholars, students, practitioners, and policymakers in public health, health communication, health psychology, and related areas.",

Each chapter pertains to a component of the physical exam and/or organ system. Examples include appropriate survey and screening of the integument, the significance of buccal/dental integrity, tailoring cardiovascular remedies and balancing prostate cancer screening with quality of life. The book follows the methodical approach of a comprehensive wellness visit, including inventory of psychosocial factors, which significantly impact physical well-being. Justification for often overlooked topics in the review of systems, such as sexual history and satisfaction, relationship issues, and vocational fulfillment are provided. This book is written in the spirit of the rich bedside acumen and the art of healing, we must strive to protect. While informative and stimulating, this text serves to remind us of the specialized diagnostic tools we carry between our ears, and the power of healing we possess in our hands as well as the counsel and education we provide to our patients. Men’s Health: A Head to Toe Guide for Clinicians serves as an important and readily accessible resource for primary care physicians, internists and fa mily doctors, physician’s assistants and nurse practitioners who care for adult males.",

    "description": "Truly global in scope and with contributions from leading researchers around the world, The Handbook of Cannabis is the definitive resource on this fascinating drug. Combining scientific perspectives and clinical applications, it covers a vast array of topics, from why over the centuries cannabis has been used as a medicine, through the regulations facing those wishing to self-administer cannabis or provide cannabis-based medicines, to the chemical structure of its many constituents and the rapidly growing group of synthetic cannabinoids that are currently being used for 'legal highs'. With each chapter written by a group of one or more internationally recognised subject experts, it provides academics and researchers with authoritative scientific material on the main pharmacological actions and their effects, as well as their pharmacokinetics, metabolism, and forensic detection. In addition it also examines the complex morphology, cultivation, harvesting, and processing of cannabis and the ways in which the plant's chemical composition can be controlled. As well as offering a raft of scientific information there is extensive coverage of cannabinoid-based medicines. Helping readers to identify and evaluate their benefits, chapters explore pharmacological actions and the effects that seem to underlie approved therapeutic uses, how they are currently used to treat certain disorders, and the ever-growing number of wide-ranging potential clinical applications. There is also coverage of both the legal and illegal sources of cannabis, including 'coffee shops' and 'cannabis dispensaries'. The complex issue of 'recreational cannabis' is also tackled. The sought-after and adverse psychological and non-psychological effects are described and discussions are included on how some adverse effects can be lessened by at least one constituent of cannabis, and that it might be possible to reduce the harm that cannabis does to some by changing current regulatory policies. The Handbook of Cannabis is a one-stop reference; essential reading for all clinicians, pharmacologists, psychologists, and psychiatrists interested in this drug, as well as those working in the field of public health.",

    "description": "To treat disease or correct genetic disorders using gene therapy, the most suitable vehicle must be able to deliver genes to the appropriate tissues and cells in the body in a specific as well as safe and effective manner. While viruses are the most popular vehicles to date, their disadvantages include toxicity, limited size of genes they can carry, and limited scale of industrial production. Polymeric Gene Delivery: Principles and Applications is the first comprehensive book to specifically address polymeric gene delivery systems. Uniting the expertise of international academic and industrial scientists who are working in the area of polymeric vectors for gene delivery, it is written by prominent researchers directly involved in this field. The book is divided into five sections that deal with challenges and opportunities in gene delivery and the efficient delivery of genes into somatic cells using polymeric vectors. The authors discuss using biodegradable polymers, condensing and non-condensing polymeric systems, microspheres and nanospheres, and designing specialized delivery systems based on targeting strategies. Polymeric Gene Delivery: Principles and Applications accentuates the versatility of polymeric delivery systems, including the potential for biocompatibility, the ability to design their formulation and geometry for a specific purpose, and the ease of modification to the surface of polymeric carriers. This book is an up-to-date guide for researchers in the field and those interested in entering this dynamic field.",

    "description": "This book grew out of an effort to salvage a potentially useful idea for greatly simplifying traditional quantitative risk assessments of the human health consequences of using antibiotics in food animals. In 2001, the United States FDA’s Center for Veterinary Medicine (CVM) (FDA-CVM, 2001) published a risk assessment model for potential adverse human health consequences of using a certain class of antibiotics, fluoroquinolones, to treat flocks of chickens with fatal respiratory disease caused by infectious bacteria. CVM’s concern was that fluoroquinolones are also used in human medicine, raising the possibility that fluoroquinolone-resistant strains of bacteria selected by use of fluoroquinolones in chickens might infect humans and then prove resistant to treatment with human medicines in the same class of antibiotics, such as ciprofloxacin. As a foundation for its risk assessment model, CVM proposed a dramatically simple approach that skipped many of the steps in traditional risk assessment. The basic idea was to assume that human health risks were directly proportional to some suitably defined exposure metric. In symbols: Risk = K × Exposure, where “Exposure” would be defined in terms of a metric such as total production of chicken contaminated with fluoroquinolone-resistant bacteria that might cause human illnesses, and “Risk” would describe the expected number of cases per year of human illness due to fluoroquinolone-resistant bacterial infections caused by chicken and treated with fluoroquinolones.",

    "description": "This is a book of psychiatry at its most practical level. It answers the sorts of questions psychiatrists ask on a daily basis. What treatments are available for the condition this patient has? What is the evidence for the effectiveness of each of these treatments? Is there any value in combinations of treatment? And, can I be sure that the evidence and recommendations are free from bias? This handy pocket reference summarises the key elements of the Cambridge Textbook of Effective Treatments in Psychiatry. The text has been revised to provide the most up-to-date evidence for treatment decisions, with an accompanying summary table for each chapter to reinforce the recommendations. It is an essential guide for mental health professionals of all disciplines as well as medical students and trainees.",

    "description": "Even after years of training and hard work, finding yourself on the threshold of your nursing career is often a daunting prospect. In this revised and updated second edition, Jackie Hole provides clear, practical advice on both managing the transition from student to qualified nurse - including getting the most from your final placement and making applications - and practical advice on key areas encountered in the first weeks and months after qualification. Drug safety, dealing with common clinical problems, and how and when to seek expert advice are all covered, while a newly written chapter addresses the key area of infection control. Management aspects such as delegation, objective setting, budgeting, prioritisation of care and time management are outlined clearly and engagingly, along with questions of professional development and career futures. This book will be invaluable to newly-qualified nurses, as well as to student nurses, nurse tutors, and experienced nurses wishing to gain an insight into their own practice and changes in the profession.",

    "description": "As nurses face the ongoing challenges of an increasing need for their services combined with economic pressures, members of the largest profession in health care must become more visible, vocal, and influential. The first communication guidebook designed expressly for nurses, From Silence to Voice helps nurses understand and overcome the self-silencing that often leads RNs to downplay their own expertise and their contributions to the care of the sick and the health of the public. Bernice Buresh and Suzanne Gordon teach nurses, nurse educators, and nurse researchers critical skills they can use to explain their work to other health-care professionals, journalists, policymakers, and political representatives. From Silence to Voice features stories about nurses who ensure that patients receive appropriate, timely, and even life-saving care, nurses who make all the difference while crises are underway but whose contributions are neglected in medical charts and thank-you notes, nurses who are left out altogether or obscured by the generic \"nurse.\" However, the book also provides detailed accounts of nurses who do make their voices heard, who do make their concerns public-- and it shows how those successes can be duplicated. Buresh and Gordon draw on real-world examples that will help nurses to - gain respect for themselves as professionals, - communicate well with both patients and health-care colleagues, - understand how the news media work, - collaborate with public relations professionals, - write effective letters to the editor and publish op-ed pieces, - appear on television and radio, and - promote research on nursing.",

Through these examples of success and failure, the book develops a blueprint for building a career in clinical research. Future medical practice depends on the quality of the clinical trials to which drugs, devices, and treatment procedures are subjected today. However, clinical trials are not easy to do, and many physicians and health care providers who attempt clinical research struggle in this endeavor, primarily because of lack of instruction. Clinical Research aims to fill the gap between training and research through case studies of a long-time clinical researcher’s rich and varied experiences.",

    "description": "\"More than 2 million Americans suffer from seizures. Each year, almost 200,000 people experience a seizure for the first time and approximately 100,000 require hospital admissions. The majority of these patients receive care from primary care physicians and general neurologists. Epilepsy in Clinical Practice: A Case Study Approach highlights dramatic diagnostic and therapeutic advances that impact upon the medical care of patients with epilepsy. Computerized imaging studies, new and improved medications, refined brain surgery techniques, increased experience with the ketogenic diet, and the Food and Drug Administration approval of the vagal nerve stimulator have elevated the state of the art. Medical decision making has correspondingly increased in complexity. This book lends clarity and confidence to the practical management of patients with seizures. For easy accessibility to key information, the book is organized into two sections. Management approaches to epilepsy are reviewed through a series of case studies that present the most common problems seen in clinical practice. This is followed by extensive appendices that include tables, charts, and checklists, web sites for physicians and patients, state driving regulations, summer camps for children with epilepsy, local affiliates of the Epilepsy Foundation, contact telephone numbers for pharmaceutical companies, and numerous other resources.\"",

In Leukemia: Methods and Protocols, expert researchers bring together a wide range of state-of-the-art laboratory methods and detailed protocols that are useful for both clinical and basic research scientists working on the disease. The volume provides techniques for prenatal backtracking of leukemic clone, molecular diagnosis, detection of genome-wide genetic abnormalities and profiling, identification of unknown fusion genes, monitoring of minimal residual diseases, disease modeling using murine and human primary hematopoietic cells, studying of normal and malignant hematopoiesis, identification of interacting partners with leukemia associated oncoproteins, and global characterization of genome-wide epigenetic changes in leukemic cells. Written in the highly successful Methods in Molecular BiologyTM series format, the convenient chapters contain brief introductions, lists of the necessary materials, step-by-step, readily reproducible protocols, and notes on troubleshooting and avoiding known pitfalls. Comprehensive and cutting-edge, Leukemia: Methods and Protocols will help researchers to advance knowledge and have a better understanding of the disease, which will ultimately facilitate development of anti-cancer therapy and improve quality of life for patients.",

    "description": "The Body In Parts examines how the body--its organs, limbs, and viscera--were represented in the literature and culture of early modern Europe. Why did sixteenth- and seventeenth-century medical, religious, and literary texts so often imagine the body part by part? What does this view of the human body tell us about social conceptions of part and whole, of individual and universal in the early modern period? As this provocative volume demonstrates, the symbolics of body parts challenge our assumptions about \"the body\" as a fundamental Renaissance image of self, society, and nation. The Body In Parts presents work by some of the leading figures in Renaissance literature and culture: Nancy Vickers on corporeal fragments; Peter Stallybrass on the foot; Marjorie Garber on joints; Stephen Greenblatt on bodily marking and mutilation; Gail Kern Paster on the nervous system; Michael Schoenfeldt on the belly; Jeffrey Masten on the anus; Katharine Park on the clitoris; Kathryn Schwarz on the breast; Sergei Lobanov-Rostovsky on the eye; Katherine Rowe on the hands; Scott Stevens on the heart and brain; Carla Mazzio on the tongue; and David Hillman on the entrails.--",

This holds especially for emergency preparedness and health risk reduction, which are all essentially spatial problems. To date, however, many initiatives have remained disconnected and uncoordinated, leading to less powerful, less compatible and less widely implemented systems than might otherwise have been the case. The important matters discussed here include the probabilistic nature of most environmental hazards and the semi-random factors that influence interactions between these and human exposures; the effects of temporal and spatial scales on hazard assessment and imputed risk; the effects of measurement error in risk estimation and the stratification of risks and their impacts according to socioeconomic characteristics; and the quantification of socioeconomic differences in vulnerability and susceptibility to environmental hazards.",

    "description": "Living healthy is all one wants, but the genetics behind creation of every human is different. As a curse or human agony, some are born with congenital defects in their menu of the genome. Just one has to live with that! The complexity of cystic fibrosis condition, which is rather a slow-killer, affects various organ systems of the human body complicating further with secondary infections. That's what makes the disease so puzzling for which scientists around the world are trying to understand better and to find a cure. Though they narrowed down to a single target gene, the tentacles of the disease reach many unknown corners of the human body. Decades of scientific research in the field of chronic illnesses like this one surely increased the level of life expectancy. This book is the compilation of interesting chapters contributed by eminent interdisciplinary scientists around the world trying to make the life of cystic fibrosis patients better.",
