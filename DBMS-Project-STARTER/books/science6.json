    "description": "In the final decades of the nineteenth century, three brilliant and visionary titans of America’s Gilded Age—Thomas Edison, Nikola Tesla, and George Westinghouse—battled bitterly as each vied to create a vast and powerful electrical empire. In Empires of Light, historian Jill Jonnes portrays this extraordinary trio and their riveting and ruthless world of cutting-edge science, invention, intrigue, money, death, and hard-eyed Wall Street millionaires. At the heart of the story are Thomas Alva Edison, the nation’s most famous and folksy inventor, creator of the incandescent light bulb and mastermind of the world’s first direct current electrical light networks; the Serbian wizard of invention Nikola Tesla, elegant, highly eccentric, a dreamer who revolutionized the generation and delivery of electricity; and the charismatic George Westinghouse, Pittsburgh inventor and tough corporate entrepreneur, an industrial idealist who in the era of gaslight imagined a world powered by cheap and plentiful electricity and worked heart and soul to create it. Edison struggled to introduce his radical new direct current (DC) technology into the hurly-burly of New York City as Tesla and Westinghouse challenged his dominance with their alternating current (AC), thus setting the stage for one of the eeriest feuds in American corporate history, the War of the Electric Currents. The battlegrounds: Wall Street, the 1893 Chicago World’s Fair, Niagara Falls, and, finally, the death chamber—Jonnes takes us on the tense walk down a prison hallway and into the sunlit room where William Kemmler, convicted ax murderer, became the first man to die in the electric chair. Empires of Light is the gripping history of electricity, the “mysterious fluid,” and how the fateful collision of Edison, Tesla, and Westinghouse left the world utterly transformed. From the Hardcover edition.",

    "description": "A number of scholars have found that concepts such as mutation, selection, and random drift, which emerged from the theory of biological evolution, may also explain evolutionary phenomena in other disciplines as well. Drawing on these concepts, Professors Cavalli-Sforza and Feldman classify and systematize the various modes of transmitting \"culture\" and explore their consequences for cultural evolution. In the process, they develop a mathematical theory of the non-genetic transmission of cultural traits that provides a framework for future investigations in quantitative social and anthropological science. The authors use quantitative models that incorporate the various modes of transmission (for example, parent-child, peer-peer, and teacher-student), and evaluate data from sociology, archaeology, and epidemiology in terms of the models. They show that the various modes of transmission in conjunction with cultural and natural selection produce various rates of cultural evolution and various degrees of diversity within and between groups. The same framework can be used for explaining phenomena as apparently unrelated as linguistics, epidemics, social values and customs, and diffusion of innovations. The authors conclude that cultural transmission is an essential factor in the study of cultural change.",

    "description": "Natural gas is considered a potential bridge fuel to a low carbon economy because it is cleaner burning than its hydrocarbon rivals coal and oil. Natural gas combustion emits about two-thirds less carbon dioxide than coal and one-quarter less than oil when consumed in a typical electric power plant. Additionally, improved methods to extract natural gas from certain shale formations has significantly increased the resource profile of the United States, which has spurred other countries to try to develop shale gas. If the United States and other countries can bring large new volumes of natural gas to market, then natural gas could play a larger role in the world's economy. This book examines key aspects of global natural gas markets, including supply and demand, as well as major U.S. developments.",

    "description": "This well-known and highly successful book was first published in 1973 and has been completely re-written in subsequent editions (published in 1982 and 2003). This new Fourth Edition has become necessary because of the pace of developments in mass spectrometry of intact lipids, which has given recognition of lipid analysis and 'lipidomics' as a distinct science. To bring the book up to date with these developments, author William W. Christie is joined by co-author Xianlin Han. Although devoting considerable space to mass spectrometry and lipidomics, Lipid analysis remains a practical guide, in one volume, to the complexities of the analysis of lipids. As in past editions, it is designed to act as a primary source, of value at the laboratory bench rather than residing on a library shelf. Lipid analysis deals with the isolation, separation, identification and structural analysis of glycerolipids, including triacylglycerols, phospholipids, sphingolipids, and the various hydrolysis products of these. The chapters follow a logical sequence from the extraction of lipids to the isolation and characterization of particular lipid classes and of molecular species of each, and to the mass spectrometric analysis of lipids and lipidomics. The new influence of mass spectrometry is due mainly to the development of electrospray ionization (ESI) and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI). Most emphasis in this book is placed on ESI, which is enabling structural characterization of different lipid classes and the identification of novel lipids and their molecular species.",

    "description": "PREFACE. THE Author of this very practical treatise on Scotch Loch - Fishing desires clearly that it may be of use to all who had it. He does not pretend to have written anything new, but to have attempted to put what he has to say in as readable a form as possible. Everything in the way of the history and habits of fish has been studiously avoided, and technicalities have been used as sparingly as possible. The writing of this book has afforded him pleasure in his leisure moments, and that pleasure would be much increased if he knew that the perusal of it would create any bond of sympathy between himself and the angling community in general. This section is interleaved with blank shects for the readers notes. The Author need hardly say that any suggestions addressed to the case of the publishers, will meet with consideration in a future edition. We do not pretend to write or enlarge upon a new subject. Much has been said and written-and well said and written too on the art of fishing but loch-fishing has been rather looked upon as a second-rate performance, and to dispel this idea is one of the objects for which this present treatise has been written. Far be it from us to say anything against fishing, lawfully practised in any form but many pent up in our large towns will bear us out when me say that, on the whole, a days loch-fishing is the most convenient. One great matter is, that the loch-fisher is depend- ent on nothing but enough wind to curl the water, -and on a large loch it is very seldom that a dead calm prevails all day, -and can make his arrangements for a day, weeks beforehand whereas the stream- fisher is dependent for a good take on the state of the water and however pleasant and easy it may be for one living near the banks of a good trout stream or river, it is quite another matter to arrange for a days river-fishing, if one is looking forward to a holiday at a date some weeks ahead. Providence may favour the expectant angler with a good day, and the water in order but experience has taught most of us that the good days are in the minority, and that, as is the case with our rapid running streams, -such as many of our northern streams are, -the water is either too large or too small, unless, as previously remarked, you live near at hand, and can catch it at its best. A common belief in regard to loch-fishing is, that the tyro and the experienced angler have nearly the same chance in fishing, -the one from the stern and the other from the bow of the same boat. Of all the absurd beliefs as to loch-fishing, this is one of the most absurd. Try it. Give the tyro either end of the boat he likes give him a cast of ally flies he may fancy, or even a cast similar to those which a crack may be using and if he catches one for every three the other has, he may consider himself very lucky. Of course there are lochs where the fish are not abundant, and a beginner may come across as many as an older fisher but we speak of lochs where there are fish to be caught, and where each has a fair chance. Again, it is said that the boatman has as much to do with catching trout in a loch as the angler. Well, we dont deny that. In an untried loch it is necessary to have the guidance of a good boatman but the same argument holds good as to stream-fishing...",

    "description": "Genetic Programming Theory and Practice explores the emerging interaction between theory and practice in the cutting-edge, machine learning method of Genetic Programming (GP). The material contained in this contributed volume was developed from a workshop at the University of Michigan's Center for the Study of Complex Systems where an international group of genetic programming theorists and practitioners met to examine how GP theory informs practice and how GP practice impacts GP theory. The contributions cover the full spectrum of this relationship and are written by leading GP theorists from major universities, as well as active practitioners from leading industries and businesses. Chapters include such topics as John Koza's development of human-competitive electronic circuit designs; David Goldberg's application of \"competent GA\" methodology to GP; Jason Daida's discovery of a new set of factors underlying the dynamics of GP starting from applied research; and Stephen Freeland's essay on the lessons of biology for GP and the potential impact of GP on evolutionary theory. The book also includes chapters on the dynamics of GP, the selection of operators and population sizing, specific applications such as stock selection in emerging markets, predicting oil field production, modeling chemical production processes, and developing new diagnostics from genomic data. Genetic Programming Theory and Practice is an excellent reference for researchers working in evolutionary algorithms and for practitioners seeking innovative methods to solve difficult computing problems.",

    "description": "Sir George Darwin (1845-1912) was the second son and fifth child of Charles Darwin. After studying mathematics at Cambridge he read for the Bar, but soon returned to science and to Cambridge, where in 1883 he was appointed Plumian Professor of Astronomy and Experimental Philosophy. His family home is now the location of Darwin College. His work was concerned primarily with the effect of the sun and moon on tidal forces on Earth, and with the theoretical cosmogony which evolved from practical observation: he formulated the fission theory of the formation of the moon (that the moon was formed from still-molten matter pulled away from the Earth by solar tides). This volume of his collected papers covers periodic orbits and some miscellaneous papers, including two investigating the health statistics of the marriage of first cousins - of interest to a member of a dynasty in which such marriages were common.",

The symposiumwascomposedof twotracks: Theory andApplications/Te- nology.The opening lecture was given by Avi Wigdersonand eight other invited plenarylecturesweregivenby EricAllender, ZurabKhasidashvili, LeonidLevin, Pavel Pudl ́ ak, Florin Spanachi, Limsoon Wong, Yuri Zhuravlev and Konstantin Rudakov, and Uri Zwick. This volume contains the accepted papers of both tracks and also some of the abstracts of the invited speakers. The scope of the proposed topics for the symposium was quite broad and covered basically all areas of computer science and its applications. We received 103 papers in total. The Program Committee of the Theory Track selected 27 papers out of 62 submissions. The Program Committee of the Applications/Technology Track selected 6 papers out of 41 submissions.",

    "description": "Stephen Hawking's worldwide bestseller, A Brief History of Time, has been a landmark volume in scientific writing. Its author's engaging voice is one reason, and the compelling subjects he addresses is another: the nature of space and time, the role of God in creation, the history and future of the universe. But it is also true that in the years since its publication, readers have repeatedly told Professor Hawking of their great difficulty in understanding some of the book's most important concepts. This is the origin of and the reason for A Briefer History of Time: its author's wish to make its content accessible to readers - as well as to bring it up-to-date with the latest scientific observations and findings. Although this book is literally somewhat 'briefer', it actually expands on the great subjects of the original. Purely technical concepts, such as the mathematics of chaotic boundary conditions, are gone. Conversely, subjects of wide interest that were difficult to follow because they were interspersed throughout the book have now been given entire chapters of their own, including relativity, curved space, and quantum theory. This reorganization has allowed the authors to expand areas of special interest and recent progress, from the latest developments in string theory to exciting developments in the search for a complete, unified theory of all the forces of physics. Like prior editions of the book-but even more so - A Briefer History of Time will guide nonscientists everywhere in the ongoing search for the tantalizing secrets at the heart of time and space. Thirty-eight full-colour illustrations enhance the text and make A Briefer History of Time an exhilarating addition in its own right to the literature of science.",

    "description": "'My new favourite book of all time' Bill Gates TOP TEN SUNDAY TIMES BESTSELLER Is modernity really failing? Or have we failed to appreciate progress and the ideals that make it possible? If you follow the headlines, the world in the 21st century appears to be sinking into chaos, hatred, and irrationality. Yet Steven Pinker shows that this is an illusion - a symptom of historical amnesia and statistical fallacies. If you follow the trendlines rather than the headlines, you discover that our lives have become longer, healthier, safer, happier, more peaceful, more stimulating and more prosperous - not just in the West, but worldwide. Such progress is no accident: it's the gift of a coherent and inspiring value system that many of us embrace without even realizing it. These are the values of the Enlightenment: of reason, science, humanism and progress. The challenges we face today are formidable, including inequality, climate change, Artificial Intelligence and nuclear weapons. But the way to deal with them is not to sink into despair or try to lurch back to a mythical idyllic past; it's to treat them as problems we can solve, as we have solved other problems in the past. In making the case for an Enlightenment newly recharged for the 21st century, Pinker shows how we can use our faculties of reason and sympathy to solve the problems that inevitably come with being products of evolution in an indifferent universe. We will never have a perfect world, but - defying the chorus of fatalism and reaction - we can continue to make it a better one.",

    "description": "In einem außergewöhnlichen Modell internationaler Zusammenarbeit für ein einziges, gemeinsames Ziel haben sich mehr als 2000 Wissenschaftler des Census of Marine Life in alte Aufzeichnungen vertieft, sind in die heutigen Meere hinabgetaucht und haben Szenarien für die Zukunft entwickelt. Zusammen haben sie uns ein unbezahlbares Geschenk gemacht: ein erweitertes und verbessertes Verständnis vom Leben im Meer und seiner Bedeutung für all das, was den Menschen am Herzen liegt – Gesundheit, Wirtschaft, Sicherheit und, am wichtigsten, einen Planeten, der für uns da ist. Nun liegt uns ein Destillat ihrer Herkulesarbeit aus zehn Jahren Forschung vor, von den Autoren und Beteiligten wundervoll illustriert und wortgewandt formuliert. Manche werden Schatzkammer Ozean als wertvolles Nachschlagewerk schätzen, andere als einen Ort dramatischer Abenteuer.\" Aus dem Vorwort von Sylvia Earle In Schatzkammer Ozean berichten Insider von der \"Volkszählung in den Weltmeeren\", dem Census of Marine Life, und beschreiben, was uns dieses umfassende Forschungsprojekt über ein ernstlich bedrohtes Ökosystem verrät. Der Census of Marine Life wurde im Jahr 2000 mit dem Ziel ins Leben gerufen, eine globale Bestandsaufnahme der Organismen in den Ozeanen der Erde durchzuführen. Zweitausend Wissenschaftler aus 82 Nationen einte dabei das Ziel, drei wichtige Fragen zu beantworten: Was lebte einst in den Weltmeeren? Was lebt heute dort? Was wird in Zukunft dort leben? Mit Abschluss der Volkszählung werden Wissenschaftler auf der ganzen Welt eine Fülle wichtiger Daten zur Verfügung haben, deren Auswertung noch Jahrzehnte in Anspruch nehmen wird. Diese Daten werden helfen, so einfache Fragen zu beantworten wie \"Was wird aus den Haien, Walen, Riffen und Lachsen werden?\" Das vorliegende Buch befasst sich mit dem Abenteuer und den Erfahrungen der Census-Forschung sowie mit dem Prozess der Datenerhebung, und es offenbart dabei auch die Geschichten hinter der Wissenschaft. Die Autoren stellen die faszinierendsten Erkenntnisse und die spannendsten Entdeckungen vor, sie schildern den Nervenkitzel und die zu überwindenden Schwierigkeiten - begleitet von fantastischen Bildern, die während der Census-Untersuchungen entstanden sind. Das Buch ist durchgehend vierfarbig illustriert und bietet informative Bildunterschriften und Exkurse. Der Text ist anregend geschrieben, und die Fotos sind so schön, wie sie korrekt sind. Die Information ist umfassend, überzeugend und aktuell und repräsentiert das Ergebnis einer enormen gemeinsamen Anstrengung vieler führender Wissenschaftler der Welt. Der Aufbau des Buches folgt der dreiteiligen Census-Zielsetzung. Einzelne Abschnitte widmen sich zudem so verschiedenen Themen wie der Logistik der ozeanischen Volkszählung und den hochmodernen Techniken, die zum Einsatz kamen, um die ungewisse Zukunft der Weltmeere zu erfassen. Schatzkammer Ozean ist die einzigartige Aufzeichnung einer monumentalen globalen Unternehmung und wird ein breites Publikum mit unterschiedlichsten Interessen ansprechen. [Der Census of Marine Life ist ein globales Netzwerk von Forschern aus mehr als 80 Nationen, die in einer wissenschaftlichen Zehn-Jahres-Initiative die Vielfalt, Verteilung und Häufigkeit des Lebens in den Ozeanen bewerten und erklären wollen. Diese weltweit erste umfassende Volkszählung in den Weltmeeren - in Vergangenheit, Gegenwart und Zukunft - wird im Jahr 2010 abgeschlossen sein und öffentlich gemacht werden.

    "description": "‘Highly accessible...revolutionary to a glorious degree’ Observer Reading maps or reading emotions? Barbie or Lego? Do you have a female brain or a male brain? Or is that the wrong question? We live in a gendered world where we are bombarded with messages about sex and gender. On a daily basis we face deeply ingrained beliefs that your sex determines your skills and preferences, from toys and colours to career choice and salaries. But what does this constant gendering mean for our thoughts, decisions and behaviour? And what does it mean for our brains? Drawing on her work as a professor of cognitive neuroimaging, Gina Rippon unpacks the stereotypes that bombard us from our earliest moments and shows how these messages mould our ideas of ourselves and even shape our brains. By exploring new, cutting-edge neuroscience, Rippon urges us to move beyond a binary view of our brains and instead to see these complex organs as highly individualised, profoundly adaptable, and full of unbounded potential. Rigorous, timely and liberating, The Gendered Brain has huge repercussions for women and men, for parents and children, and for how we identify ourselves.

    "publishedDate": "1997",
    "description": "Major accidents are rare events due to the many barriers, safeguards and defences developed by modern technologies. But they continue to happen with saddening regularity and their human and financial consequences are all too often unacceptably catastrophic. One of the challenges facing the next millennium is to develop more effective ways of both understanding and limiting their occurrence.This lucid book presents a set of common principles to further our knowledge of the causes of major accidents in a wide variety of high technology systems. It also describes tools and techniques for managing the risks of such organizational accidents that go beyond those currently available to system managers and safety professionals.The Author deals comprehensively with the prevention of major accidents arising from human and organizational causes. He argues that the same general principles and management techniques are appropriate for many different domains. These include banks and insurance companies just as much as nuclear power plants, oil exploration and production companies, chemical process installations and air, sea and rail transport.Its unique combination of principles and practicalities make this book essential reading for those people whose daily business is to manage, audit and regulate hazardous technologies of all kinds. It is relevant to those concerned with understanding and controlling human and organizational factors and will also interest academic readers and those working in industrial and government agencies.",

Their work opened up a new area of brain research that led to their receiving the Nobel Prize in 1981. The book contains their major papers from 1959 to 1981, each preceded and followed by comments telling how and why the authors went about the study, how the work was received, and what has happened since. It begins with short autobiographies of both men, and describes the state of the field when they started. It is intended not only for neurobiologists, but for anyone interested in how the brain works-biologists, psychologists, philosophers, physicists, historians of science, and students at all levels from high school to graduate level.",

Reading this book changed me' Oprah Winfrey The highly anticipated new book from Malcolm Gladwell, international bestselling author of The Tipping Point, Blink, Outliers, What the Dog Saw and David and Goliath The routine traffic stop that ends in tragedy. The spy who spends years undetected at the highest levels of the Pentagon. The false conviction of Amanda Knox. Why do we so often get other people wrong? Why is it so hard to detect a lie, read a face or judge a stranger's motives? Through a series of encounters and misunderstandings - from history, psychology and infamous legal cases - Malcolm Gladwell takes us on an intellectual adventure into the darker side of human nature, where strangers are never simple and misreading them can have disastrous consequences. No one challenges our shared assumptions like Malcolm Gladwell. Here he uses stories of deceit and fatal errors to cast doubt on our strategies for dealing with the unknown, inviting us to rethink our thinking in these troubled times.",

Brian Arthur explores the extraordinary way in which the technology that surrounds us and allows us to live our modern lives has actually been developed. Rather than coming from a series of one-off inventions, almost all the technology we use today comes from previous developments: these technologies are not being created, but are instead evolving. With fascinating examples, from laser printers to powerplants, Arthur reveals how our own problem-solving skills and creative vision can evolve alongside these technologies, and how this understanding can even improve our understanding of the wider world.",

In this beautiful and mind-bending introduction to modern physics, Carlo Rovelli explains Einstein's theory of general relativity, quantum mechanics, black holes, the complex architecture of the universe, elementary particles, gravity, and the nature of the mind. In under eighty pages, readers will understand the most transformative scientific discoveries of the twentieth century and what they mean for us. Not since Richard Feynman's celebrated best-seller Six Easy Pieces has physics been so vividly, intelligently and entertainingly revealed.",

    "description": "An astonishing new scientific discovery called neuroplasticity is overthrowing the centuries-old notion that the adult human brain is fixed and unchanging. It is, instead, able to change its own structure and function, even into old age. Psychiatrist and researcher Norman Doidge, MD, travelled around the United States to meet the brilliant scientists championing neuroplasticity, and the people whose lives they’ve transformed — people whose mental limitations or brain damage were previously seen as unalterable, and whose conditions had long been dismissed as hopeless. We see a woman born with half a brain that rewired itself to work as a whole; a woman labelled retarded who cured her deficits with brain exercises and now cures those of others; blind people who learn to see; learning disorders cured; IQs raised; ageing brains rejuvenated; stroke patients recovering their faculties; children with cerebral palsy learning to move more gracefully; entrenched depression and anxiety disappearing; and lifelong character traits changed. Doidge takes us onto terrain that might seem fantastic. We learn that our thoughts can switch our genes on and off, altering our brain anatomy. We learn how people of average intelligence can, with brain exercises, improve their cognition and perception, develop muscle strength, or learn to play a musical instrument — simply by imagining doing so. Using personal stories from the heart of this neuroplasticity revolution, Dr Doidge has written an immensely moving, inspiring book that will permanently alter the way we look at our brains, human nature, and human potential.",

    "description": "IL NUOVO LIBRO DELL'AUTORE DI OGNI COSA OGNI COSA È ILLUMINATA «Il messaggio di Foer è al tempo stesso commovente e doloroso, scoraggiante e ottimistico, e costringerà i lettori a rivedere il proprio impegno nel combattere ‘la più grande crisi che l’umanità abbia mai dovuto affrontare’.» Publishers Weekly Qualcuno si ostina a liquidare i cambiamenti climatici come fake news, ma la gran parte di noi è ben consapevole che se non modifichiamo radicalmente le nostre abitudini l’umanità andrà incontro al rischio dell’estinzione di massa. Lo sappiamo, eppure non riusciamo a crederci. E di conseguenza non riusciamo ad agire. Il problema è che l’emergenza ambientale non è una storia facile da raccontare e, soprattutto, non è una buona storia: non spaventa, non affascina, non coinvolge abbastanza da indurci a cambiare la nostra vita. Per questo rimaniamo indifferenti, o paralizzati: la stessa reazione che suscitò Jan Karski, il «testimone inascolta\u00adto», quando cercò di svelare l’orro\u00adre dell’Olocausto e non fu creduto. In tempo di guerra, veniva chiesto ai cittadini di contribuire allo sforzo bellico: ma qual è il confine tra rinuncia e sacrificio, quando in gioco c’è la nostra sopravvivenza, o la \u00adsopravvivenza dei nostri figli? E quali sono le rinunce necessarie, adesso, per salvare un mondo ormai trasformato in una immensa fattoria a cielo aperto? Nel suo nuovo libro, Jonathan Safran Foer mette in campo tutte le sue risorse di scrittore per raccontare, con straordinario impatto emotivo, la crisi climatica che è anche «crisi della nostra capacità di credere», mescolando in modo originalissimo storie di famiglia, ri\u00adcordi personali, episodi biblici, dati scienti\u00adfici rigorosi e suggestioni futuristiche. Un libro unico, che parte dalla volontà di «convincere degli sconosciuti a fare qualcosa» e termina con un messaggio rivolto ai figli, ai quali ciascun genitore – non solo a parole, ma con le proprie scelte – spera di riuscire a insegnare «la differenza tra correre verso la morte, correre per sfuggire alla morte e correre verso la vita».",

    "description": "Bill's own fascination with science began with a battered old schoolbook he had when he was about ten or eleven years old in America. It had an illustration that captivated him - a cutaway diagram showing Earth's interior as it would look if you cut into it with a large knife and carefully removed about a quarter of its bulk. And he very clearly remembers thinking: \"How do they know that?\" Bill's story-telling skill makes the \"How?\" and, just as importantly, the \"Who?\" of scientific discovery entertaining and accessible for all ages. In this exciting edition for younger readers, he covers the wonder and mysteries of time and space, the frequently bizarre and often obsessive scientists and the methods they used, the crackpot theories which held sway for far too long, the extraordinary accidental discoveries which suddenly advanced whole areas of science when the people were actually looking for something else (or in the wrong direction) and the mind-boggling fact that, somehow, the universe exists and, against all odds, life came to be on this wondrous planet we call home.",

    "description": "This didactically unrivalled textbook and timeless reference by Nobel Prize Laureate Claude Cohen-Tannoudji separates essential underlying principles of quantum mechanics from specific applications and practical examples and deals with each of them in a different section. Chapters emphasize principles; complementary sections supply applications. The book provides a qualitative introduction to quantum mechanical ideas; a systematic, complete and elaborate presentation of all the mathematical tools and postulates needed, including a discussion of their physical content and applications. The book is recommended on a regular basis by lecturers of undergraduate courses.",
