    "description": "The primary strength of BEGINNINGS AND BEYOND, 8TH EDITION, is its blend of simplicity and depth. In a clear and easy-to-understand style, the book's five sections lay out basic questions any student of early childhood education would want answered. At the same time, the chapters present key concepts, the latest research, and practical examples so that questions are thoroughly answered. Coverage of the current Developmentally Appropriate Practices (DAP) are woven throughout the text and highlighted by new margin icons and DAP footnotes for easy reference. Diversity and development are also integrated throughout the text, enabling readers to understand that issues of age, gender, race/ethnicity, ability, and family are part of every aspect of teaching and learning. Every chapter has an article by an educator that highlights a relevant topic, showing students of early childhood education that there are many authoritative and experienced voices to learn from, both from the past and present. Finally, through its tone, numerous visuals, and carefully crafted pedagogy, the book is accessible to and respectful of readers with a range of abilities and learning styles.

    "description": "A MAN OF DESTINY is an Epic about the life of Giuseppe Garibaldi and his struggle to free Italy from outside rulers. Up until 1871 Italy was composed of many rulers: Austria in the North East, a King over Naples and Sicily, a Sardinian King in the North West, a French Emperor who ruled over Rome, and different Princes ruling over Central Italy. Italians spoke many different dialects, but after the unification only one language was spoken. Giuseppe Garibaldi's destiny was to unite Italy as one country. He and his famous Red-Shirts had to fight many rulers in 1870. He first began by conquering Sicily and worked his way north. He was considered a hero especially by European women who adored him.",

It has been recommended by a number of IELTS academics that students engage in practicing for the IELTS exam daily, at least six months in advance, to give them a better chance at getting the score they need. Of course, that means you're going to need LOTS of IELTS practice tests to help you get prepared! Through practicing these questions, and other questions in the series, you’ll be able to become more familiar with the types of questions asked in the exam, and be better able to answer confidently.",

    "description": "This book demonstrates the vital connection between language and gesture, and why it is critical for research on second language acquisition to take into account the full spectrum of communicative phenomena. The study of gesture in applied linguistics is just beginning to come of age. This edited volume, the first of its kind, covers a broad range of concerns that are central to the field of SLA. The chapters focus on a variety of second-language contexts, including adult classroom and naturalistic learners, and represent learners from a variety of language and cultural backgrounds. Gesture: Second Language Acquisition and Classroom Research is organized in five sections: Part I, Gesture and its L2 Applications, provides both an overview of gesture studies and a review of the L2 gesture research. Part II, Gesture and Making Meaning in the L2, offers three studies that all take an explicitly sociocultural view of the role of gesture in SLA. Part III, Gesture and Communication in the L2, focuses on the use and comprehension of gesture as an aspect of communication. Part IV, Gesture and Linguistic Structure in the L2, addresses the relationship between gesture and the acquisition of linguistic features, and how gesture relates to proficiency. Part V, Gesture and the L2 Classroom, considers teachers’ gestures, students’ gestures, and how students’ interpret teachers’ gestures. Although there is a large body of research on gesture across a number of disciplines including anthropology, communications, psychology, sociology, and child development, to date there has been comparatively little investigation of gesture within applied linguistics. This volume provides readers unfamiliar with L2 gesture studies with a powerful new lens with which to view many aspects of language in use, language learning, and language teaching.",

There is another, how ever, still Inore interesting, which he occa sionally mixes with it-the causes which affect the happiness and comfort of the lamer orders of society, which in every natiop form the most numerous class, These two subjects are, no doubt, nearly connected but the nature and extent of this copexion, and the mode in which in-VOL. XII. B creasing 2 Of increasing Wealth, us it Bk. iii. creasing wealth operates on the condition of the poor, have not been stated with suf ficient correctness and precision. Adam Smith, inhis chapter on the wages of labour, considers every increase in the stock or revenue of the society as an in crease in the funds for the maintenance of labour and having before laid down the I position that the demand for those who live by wages can only increase irr proportion to the increase of the funds for the pay nent of wages, the conclusiorl naturally, follo vs, that every increase of wealth tends to in crease the demand for Iabour and to im prove the condition of the lower classes of society . Upon a nearer examination, however, it will he found that the funds for the malnte nailce of labour do not necessarily increase with the increase of wealth, and very rarely increase in proportion to it and that the condition of the lower classes of society does not depend exclusively upon the in crease of the funds for the maintenance of Vol. i. book i. C. 8. labour, Ch. xiii. cts the Coadition ofthe Poor.",

    "description": "Events in Rwanda in 1994 mark a landmark in the history of modern genocide. Up to one million people were killed in a planned public and political campaign. In the face of indisputable evidence, the UN Security Council failed miserably in its response. In this classic of investigative journalism, Linda Melvern tells the compelling story of what really happened, revealing both the scale, speed and intensity of the unfolding genocide, as well as exposing the governments and individuals who could have prevented what was happening, if they had chosen to act. The book also tells the unrecognised heroism of those who stayed on during the genocide -- from volunteer peacekeepers to courageous NGO workers. Twenty-five years on from one of the darkest episodes in modern history, A People Betrayed is a shocking indictment of how Rwanda was ignored then and how today it is remembered in the West.",

    "description": "Latino men and boys in the United States are confronted with a wide variety of hardships that are not easily explained or understood. They are populating prisons, dropping out of high school, and are becoming overrepresented in the service industry at alarming degrees. Young Latino men, especially, have among the lowest wages earned in the country, a rapidly growing rate of HIV/AIDS, and one of the highest mortality rates due to homicide. Although there has been growing interest in the status of men in American society, there is a glaring lack of research and scholarly work available on Latino men and boys. This groundbreaking interdisciplinary volume, edited by renowned scholars Pedro Noguera, Aída Hurtado and Edward Fergus addresses the dearth of scholarship and information about Latino men and boys to further our understanding of the unique challenges and obstacles that they confront during this historical moment. The contributors represent a cross section of disciplines from health, criminal justice, education, literature, psychology, economics, labor, sociology and more. By drawing attention to the sweeping issues facing this segment of the population, this volume offers research and policy a set of principles and overarching guidelines for decreasing the invisibility and thus the disenfranchisement of Latino men and boys.",

    "description": "If you are a young person, and you work hard enough, you can get a college degree and set yourself on the path to a good life, right? Not necessarily, says Sara Goldrick-Rab, and with Paying the Price, she shows in damning detail exactly why. Quite simply, college is far too expensive for many people today, and the confusing mix of federal, state, institutional, and private financial aid leaves countless students without the resources they need to pay for it. Drawing on an unprecedented study of 3,000 young adults who entered public colleges and universities in Wisconsin in 2008 with the support of federal aid and Pell Grants, Goldrick-Rab reveals the devastating effect of these shortfalls. Half the students in the study left college without a degree, while less than 20 percent finished within five years. The cause of their problems, time and again, was lack of money. Unable to afford tuition, books, and living expenses, they worked too many hours at outside jobs, dropped classes, took time off to save money, and even went without adequate food or housing. In many heartbreaking cases, they simply left school—not with a degree, but with crippling debt. Goldrick-Rab combines that shocking data with devastating stories of six individual students, whose struggles make clear the horrifying human and financial costs of our convoluted financial aid policies. America can fix this problem. In the final section of the book, Goldrick-Rab offers a range of possible solutions, from technical improvements to the financial aid application process, to a bold, public sector–focused “first degree free” program. What’s not an option, this powerful book shows, is doing nothing, and continuing to crush the college dreams of a generation of young people.",

    "description": "Revised to reflect recent ethical, legal, and professional developments, Welfel’s ETHICS IN COUNSELING AND PSYCHOTHERAPY prepares readers to deal effectively with the issues they will confront in practice. The book’s ten-step model for ethical decision making guides students and practitioners as they work through and analyze complicated ethics cases that demonstrate some of the most challenging dilemmas they will face. Updated to integrate the new 2014 ACA Code of Ethics, this edition also explores how technology (including social networking) relates to ethical issues, and discusses the ethical issues that may arise when counseling clients from different cultural backgrounds, clients with disabilities, older adults, and clients at risk of harming others and themselves. The text familiarizes readers with the field’s key scholarly writings and, by examining emerging ethical issues, enables students to advance beyond their basic awareness and knowledge of the professional codes of ethics.

    "authors": [
     "Robyn Jorgensen"

    "publishedDate": "2019-10",
    "description": "Since its first publication, this book has established a strong reputation for its valuable insights into the evidence-based approaches to effectively teach primary mathematics and the practical theory behind those teaching strategies. Based on the latest international research, the expert authors focus on learning outcomes and the general principles that underlie educational practices rather than any specific curriculum. Current approaches to mathematics education are explained and critiqued, and insights into why some students have difficulties with mathematics are provided. Teachers are shown how to encourage their students to develop deep learning in mathematics, and to relate mathematics to the rest of the curriculum. The book first examines the philosophy behind mathematics and its impact on curriculum design, the history of learning outcomes, and theories on how students learn mathematics. The key areas of mathematics teaching are then outlined in detail: number, probability and statistics, measurement, geometry, and algebra. In each area, the emphasis is on problem-solving. Finally, practical classroom issues are discussed such as the trend towards developing students' capacity to think mathematically, broad approaches to teaching mathematics, planning for a whole school approach to mathematics, diversity and access, and assessment, reporting and evaluation. A new focus on numeracy and the integration of digital technologies to enhance mathematics education have been incorporated in this edition. Featuring practical activities that can be implemented in the classroom, together with diagram, graphs and other visual aids, this book is an invaluable resource for university lecturers as well as pre-service and in-service teachers.",
