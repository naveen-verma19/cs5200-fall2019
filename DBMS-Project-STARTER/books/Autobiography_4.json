I love the camps on the Miramichi for the truly beautiful natural environment, for learning to fish, and the excitement and wonder of holding a salmon before releasing it back to the river, for the camaraderie with new and old friends, for a scheduled daily block of free time, for the caring camp staff, and more. I also gained insights about myself as a learner, had the luxury to observe and experience talented guides as remarkable teachers and to have the time an opportunity to reflect upon their teaching and my learning. These days were wonderful experiences and tremendous opportunities for me personally a great vacation.",

    "description": "In Depression: A Public Feelings Project, Ann Cvetkovich seeks to understand why intellectuals, activists, professionals, and other privileged people struggle with feelings of hopeless and self-loathing. She focuses particularly on those in academia, where the pressure to succeed and the desire to find space for creative thinking and alternative worlds bump up against the harsh conditions of a ruthlessly competitive job market, the shrinking power of the humanities, and the corporatization of the university. In her candid memoir, Cvetkovich describes what it was like to move through the days as she finished her dissertation, started a job, and then completed a book for tenure. Turning to critical essay, she seeks to create new forms of writing and knowledge that don't necessarily follow the usual methods of cultural critique but instead come from affective experience, ordinary life, and alternative archives. Across its different sections, including the memoir, the book crafts - and it's no accident that crafting is one of its topics -- a cultural analysis that can adequately represent depression not as medical pathology but as a historical category, a felt experience, and a point of entry onto discussions not only about theory and contemporary culture but about how to live.",

    "description": "Voices from the Asylum analyses the writings of four female psychiatric patients in France (1850-1920). These women provide articulate descriptions of the experience of psychiatric treatment from the point of view of the patient, which in the historiography of psychiatry has traditionally been sidelined. The book uses psychoanalytical theory to closely analyse the texts, and contributes to the feminist project of writing women back into literary history,by bringing to light an unrecognised writing tradition in the prehistory of psychoanalysis: the psychiatric memoir. It views 'delusional' utterances as meaningful when read as metaphorical representations of real suffering, or compensatory strategies to ensure the survival of the self, in a social contextthat oppressed women who deviated from traditional sex-role stereotypes. Writing by patients constituted an act of resistance prefiguring revisionist histories of psychiatry that appeared later in the twentieth century.",

Combining the analysis of autobiography with the study of Communist psychology and sociology and the politics of Bolshevik self-fashioning, Halfin provides new insight into the preconditions of the Great Purge.",

Story can lift us beyond our individual borders to imagine the realities of other people, times, and places. Storytelling - both oral tradition and written word - is the foundation of being human. In this powerful book, Christina Baldwin, one of the visionaries who started the personal writing movement, explores the vital necessity of re-creating a sacred common ground for each other's stories. Each chapter in Storycatcher is carried by a fascinating narrative - about people, family, or community - intertwined with practical instruction about the nature of story, how it works, and how we can practice it in our lives. Whether exploring the personal stories revealed in our private journals, the stories of family legacy, the underlying stories that drive our organizations, or the stories that define our personal identity, Christina's book encourages us all to become storycatchers - and shows us how new stories lay the framework for a new world.\" --Publisher.",

    "publishedDate": "2004",
    "description": "A pervasive culture of confession, combined with the revolution in Internet-based communication, has crowded bookstores with autobiographies and biographies and generated an unprecedented amount of personal exposure. As columnists and reviewers tell us that we live in an age of memoir, life histories are commanding attention in many academic and professional disciplines, including anthropology, history, journalism, medicine, and psychology, as well as literary studies. Our lives are increasingly on display in public, but the ethical issues involved in presenting such revelations remain largely unexamined. How can life writing do good, and how can it cause harm? The eleven essays in this collection explore such questions. They focus chiefly on autobiography and biography, but their findings apply to all \"life writing\"-the entire class of literature in which people tell life stories. Their forms include case studies, diaries, ethnographies, interviews, and profiles. The essays are enhanced by an introduction that provides an overview of the volume, including a section on life writing vis-ā-vis privacy and the law, and an afterword that looks at the essays in relation to one another.",

'Stretching from Fry's success at Cambridge, where he met the comic love of his life, Hugh Laurie, to his first forays into television, this is one of the funniest, most generous, most daring pieces of confessional writing published in years. Most readers will want to close the book and give it a hug.' Daily Telegraph 'Extremely enjoyable.' Sunday Times 'Fascinating. Perfect prose and excruciating honesty. A grand reminiscence of college and theatre and comedyland in the 1980s, with tone-perfect showbiz anecdotes, and genuine readerly excitement. What Fry does, essentially, is tell us who he really is. A painfully honest attempt to tear the mask aside . . . we are splendidly better for it.' Observer 'Deliciously gossipy and very funny.' The Times 'Extraordinary, affectionate, engaging, cunningly planned and so crammed with incidental delights. A joyus allegro vivace of infectious comic bravura . . . gives nothing but pleasure. A delicious novel of rise and rise of a brilliant young man, which is filled with such vivid background, such unerring social observation, so many wonderful characters and such beguiling incident.'

The primary object of study is Olaudah Equiano's brilliant autobiography, which served as a prototype for later slave narratives, and thus provided a background for the development of a literary pattern followed by succeeding generations of American black writers. The autobiographical form as used by the eighteenth-century black writers is explored as a reflection of black perceptions of Western culture, and their attempt to enter the literary world.",

    "description": "What is the secret to lasting love? How do couples create a beautiful marriage of love and respect that will last for a lifetime? These are questions American writer Susan Tiberghien is asked most often at writers' conferences held in the United States and Europe. These questions took her on a journey of personal reflection. Meditating on what led her to fall in love with a Frenchman and what went right in their marriage, she recalled the good moments and began writing them down. Susan and her husband Pierre have been married for more than fifty-five years. They raised six children while living in five different countries. SIDE BY SIDE: WRITING YOUR LOVE STORY is a memoir of Susan's marriage and an invitation to you, the reader, to write your own love story with your partner. SIDE BY SIDE: WRITING YOUR LOVE STORY is organized by seven stages of a relationship: courtship, commitment, outward reflection, inward reflection, growing, wellbeing, and celebrating. Beginning with falling in love and courtship, Susan shows you how to recall those early moments of seduction and being seduced. This dance between partners is key to the next stage of commitment. Marriage is beautiful because it is a commitment couples choose to renew with one another every day. Whether you are engaged to be married, or you've been married for a few days or for more than 20,075 days (fifty-five years), it is natural to experience feelings that lead you to question the commitment you made do each other. Everyone has doubts. The journal practice exercises in this chapter help to explore both the sunny and dark side of doubts, allowing you to focus and to build on what is working in the relationship. As a couple, you face many challenges together, especially with raising children and working outside of the home. SIDE BY SIDE: WRITING YOUR LOVE STORY is filled with life stories every parent understands, especially when each partner was raised in a different country. For instance, what will be the family's common language? In addition to managing cultural differences, all parents share the same challenges around discipline, rules, and the unique needs of each child. Journal prompts provide a framework for your memories and insights. Described by her readers as a lyrical writer with a compassionate approach to telling and sharing life stories, Susan weaves her journal entries and life stories throughout the book, and adds inspirational quotes from well-known writers such as Rainer Maria Rilke, Brenda Ueland, William Zinsser, Dorothea Brande, Annie Dillard, and Thomas Merton. When you make writing a habit, you change your life story. SIDE BY SIDE: WRITING YOUR LOVE STORY teaches you how to make writing a habit and how to transform your story as a couple into your marriage memoir, expressing the best of each of you as an individual, and the powerful entity you are as two people who love each other.",

Whether used to clarify the nature of the relationship between ideology and personal experience or simply because \"oftentimes personal truth was stranger than fiction,\" the autobiography fulfilled the need to define the individual \"black self\" to a society that denied the existence of black reality. In Living Our Stories, Telling Our Truths, V.P. Franklin provides the first comprehensive examination of African-American intellectual history in over twenty-five years, presenting original interpretations of the lives and thought of twelve major black American writers and political leaders who played a central role in this powerful literary genre. Focusing on the autobiographical works of such prominent figures as Zora Neale Hurston, W.E.B. Du Bois, and Malcolm X, Gwendolyn Brooks, and James Baldwin, as well as lesser known but equally crucial figures including Alexander Crummell, who declared black Americans a \"chosen people\" of the Lord, and Ida B. Wells-Barnett, the most famous black American woman at the turn of the century, Franklin shows that the need to tell the truth to authority, to document the original cultural contributions of rural and urban blacks, and to defend the interests of the black working class has always been a principal preoccupation of African-American intellectuals. The particular areas of the \"race problem\" that these individuals chose to focus on, however, were as varied as the times in which they wrote: from James Weldon Johnson's commitment to documenting the significant artistic and cultural contributions of African-Americans and James Baldwin's view that African-Americans were destined \"to redeem the soul of America\" to Malcolm X's rejection of integrationist doctrines and Harry Haywood's determination that the leadership of the Communist Party recognize the revolutionary potential of the black working class. And through it all, the objectives are strikingly similar--self-determination, \"race vindication,\" and the struggle for freedom have all been at the core of the collective experience of African Americans in the United States. Given the negative evaluations of black culture and community coming from the larger white-dominated society, African-American intellectuals used their autobiographies to tell the truth about the nature of the black experience in this society and throughout the world. Providing personal accounts of what freedom meant and how it could be achieved, the autobiography allowed African-American intellectuals to use their personal experience as a mirror to reflect the larger social and political context for black America. A major contribution to American history, Living Our Stories, Telling Our Truths acknowledges this rich tradition and makes it clear that these works provide a vital intellectual legacy for African-Americans as they enter the twenty-first century.",

All his biographers have drawn heavily on his own autobiography, Memories & Adventures, a collection of stories and anecdotes themed on the subject of masculinity and its representation. Diana Barsham discusses Doyle's career in the context of that nineteenth-century biographical tradition which Dr Watson so successfully appropriated. The volume explores Doyle's determination to become a great name in the culture of his day and the strains on his identity arising from this project.",

Where do we stand, in the landscape of truth? How do we discover and profess the story of our life when lives are such strange and messy things? Frankly, why bother? In Tell the Truth. Make It Matter., a one-of-a-kind memoir workbook, Beth Kephart offers an insider's look at the making of true tales--and an illustrated workbook to guide the wild ride. Combining smartly selected samples with abundantly fresh ideas, dozens of original exercises with cautions, questions with answers, Kephart inspires, encourages, and persistently believes in those with a story to tell. Write this, the workbook says. Read this. Consider this. Discover who you are. Have some honest fun with words. Truth could not come from a more authoritative source--Beth Kephart, who, as an award-winning writer of 22 books, an award-winning teacher at the University of Pennsylvania, a winner of the 2013 Books for a Better Life Award (motivational category) for Handling the Truth: On the Writing of Memoir, a nationally renowned speaker, and a partner in Juncture Writing Workshops, has mastered the art of leading readers and writers toward the stories of themselves. Truth should find a home among high school teachers, college professors, workshop leaders, autodidacts, secret writers and public ones. It is the perfect (graduation, birthday, holiday, friendship) gift--to others, and to oneself.",

    "description": "In this study Trev Broughton explores developments within Victorian auto/biography and asks what they can teach us about the conditions and limits of male literary authority. She focuses on two case studies from the period 1880-1903: the auto/biographical theories and achievements of Sir Leslie Stephen, one of the century's most revered exponents of the written life; and the debate surrounding James Anthony Froude's account of the marriage of Thomas and Jane Welsh Carlyle. The author examines the proliferation of the professions with a vested interest in the 'written life'; the speeding-up and institutionalization of the Life-and-Letters industry; and the consequent spread of a network of mainly male practitioners and commentators. She argues that these elements all contributed to a new 'auto/biographical' subjectivity. Men of Letters, Writing Lives will be of interest to students and scholars of literature, cultural history, gender, and auto/biography.",

    "description": "Won the prestigious Writer's Digest award. 1,900 books entered the national competition, Miss America by Day won first place in the \"Most Inspirational Book\" category. In this award winning book, former Miss America, Marilyn Van Derbur, describes, in detail, her healing process after 13 years of incest. \"I wrote the book, not because I want someone to learn more about me but so readers can learn more about themselves. And so that loved ones can better understand the brutal recovery process and never again say, \"just get over it.\" The pain ends, I promise . . . IF you do the 'work' of healing. A loving, long-term relationship and grounded well, adjusted children await you. A judge for the Writers Digest book competition wrote: \"Seldom as a judge have I wanted to read the entire book but I devoured every word of this riveting story... Told with stark honesty and vivid details that were so important in ridding herself of the pain, torment and shame...\" Anyone who knew Marilyn Van Derbur as a child and young adult believed she had it all -- a loving family, a beautiful home, an active social life. But beneath the surface, Van Derbur was a troubled young woman who lived through horrific panic attacks and excruciating physical pain every day of her adult life. Starting when she was just a child of five, she was sexually abused by her father until she turned 18. Van Derbur uses the term \"incested,\" eschewing the more vanilla terms of \"molestation\" or \"abuse.\" As a student and young adult, Van Derbur was an overachiever with an unconscious need to stay very busy. She realizes now this was a coping mechanism to keep her two worlds separated-the \"night child\" who suffered at the hands of her father and the \"day child\" who was happy and outgoing. After being named valedictorian of her high school class, she went on to college. Persuaded to enter a local beauty pageant, she ultimately was crowned Miss America. Ignoring the sheer terror she felt at the prospect of speaking in front of others, Van Derbur went on to become a highly successful motivational speaker. She writes of her endless need to be respected by others, all the while believing that if others really knew who she was, they would hate her and look at her with disdain and disgust. The perfectly poised mask she showed the outside world was a far cry from the tortured, panic-stricken, anxious woman within. The shame she felt within was a constant in her life, reminding her that she was \"unworthy.\" When a newspaper reporter learned of her story, Van Derbur's private shame became front-page news. Then she landed on the cover of People magazine. Soon incest survivors from around the country were reaching out to her, desperate to tell someone what had happened to them. It became instantly clear that her new role in life was to help others who had suffered incest and to help teach everyone how to make sure their children are safe from predators.",

    "description": "For a long time now, readers and scholars have strained against the limits of traditional literary criticism, whose precepts—above all, \"objectivity\"—seem to have so little to do with the highly personal and deeply felt experience of literature. The Intimate Critique marks a movement away from this tradition. With their rich spectrum of personal and passionate voices, these essays challenge and ultimately breach the boundaries between criticism and narrative, experience and expression, literature and life. Grounded in feminism and connected to the race, class, and gender paradigms in cultural studies, the twenty-six contributors to this volume—including Jane Tompkins, Henry Louis Gates, Jr., Shirley Nelson Garner, and Shirley Goek-Lin Lim—respond in new, refreshing ways to literary subjects ranging from Homer to Freud, Middlemarch to The Woman Warrior, Shiva Naipaul to Frederick Douglass. Revealing the beliefs and formative life experiences that inform their essays, these writers characteristically recount the process by which their opinions took shape--a process as conducive to self-discovery as it is to critical insight. The result—which has been referred to as \"personal writing,\" \"experimental critical writing,\" or \"intellectual autobiography\"—maps a dramatic change in the direction of literary criticism.
