    "description": "This is the second monograph to be published under the auspices of Winnicott Studies, the Squiggle Foundation's renowned series of publications on contemporary applications of Winnicott's thought. Like its predecessor, which concentrated on the True and False Self, this volume focuses on a single topic: Winnicott's treatment of fathers.The volume includes a reprint of Winnicott's 1965 paper, \"A child psychiatry case illustrating delayed reaction to loss\", which is followed by John Forrester's \"On holding as a metaphor\", which expands and comments on many of the issues which Winnicott raises. John Fielding then provides an insight into Shakespeare's treatment of father-figures; Graham Lee outlines a new approach to the Oedipus complex in the light of Winnicott's insights; and Val Richards concludes with some clinical and theoretical thoughts. Taken together, these papers provide an intriguing composite picture of Winnicottian thought today, on a topic which is of increasing social and cultural interest.",

    "description": "Come invertire la rotta delle nostre paure, sciogliere i nodi del malessere, sfondare i muri dell'incubo? Agendo, risponde Alejandro Jodorowsky. Compiendo un atto paradossale che scuota l'immobilità patologica di cui siamo prigionieri. Un atto dettato dalla voce dell'inconscio e tradotto nella surreale poesia di una quotidianità trasgressiva e onirica. Jodorowsky ascolta, interroga, esplora il labirinto emotivo dei suoi interlocutori e pazienti. Senza interpretare. Senza forzare i significati. Come un regista abituato alle meraviglie e allo stupore del teatro, raccoglie dai gesti sospesi quello che può riavviare l'azione, riaccendere le luci della scena. Prese le distanze dalla sicumera scientifica della psicanalisi, Jodorowsky propone il semplice abbandono all'\"atto psicomagico\", la confidenza tra la profondità dell'esperienza e la complice, quasi omeopatica, adesione alle forme del proprio male. Guarire è, in questa \"terapia panica\", una parola stonata. Imparare a essere felici, no.",

    "description": "from the Foreword: Possibly the heartless treatment of children, from the practice of infanticide and abandonment through to the neglect, the rigors of swaddling, the purposeful starving, the beatings, the solitary confinement, and so on, was and is only one aspect of the basic aggressiveness and cruelty of human nature, of the inbred disregard of the rights and feelings of others. Children, being physically unable to resist aggression, were the victims of forces over which they had no control, and they were abused in many imaginable and some almost unimaginable ways by way of expressing conscious or more commonly unconscious motives of their elders... The present volume abounds in evidence of all kinds, from all periods and peoples. The story is monotonously painful, but it is high time that it should be told and that it should be taken into account...",

When faced with personal ineffectiveness or lagging organizational performance, most of us instinctively look for quick-fix behavioral band-aids, not recognizing the underlying mindset at the heart of our most persistent challenges. Through true stories and simple yet profound guidance and tools, The Outward Mindset enables individuals and organizations to make the one change that most dramatically improves performance, sparks collaboration, and accelerates innovation—a shift to an outward mindset.",

Taking up where that book leaves off, it traces some of the consequences of the emigration of German and Austrian psychoanalysts to London, particularly in the context of the British Psycho-Analytical Society's \"Controversial Discussions\".The first part of the book, \"Tradition and Change\" traces some general issues related to the Discussions, in particular drawing on documentary sources from the Archives of the British Psycho-Analytical Society. The second part focuses on one crucial issue in the Discussions - the differing interpretations formulated about the psychic life of babies during the first six months of life. Throughout this section, and the rest of the book, Dr Steiner constantly stresses the larger social and political contexts within which psychoanalysis exists. The last part examines the legacy of the Discussions in the work of one of the most distinguished Kleinian analysts, Hanna Segal, and in particular her work on creativity and aesthetics.",

    "description": "In The Empire of Love anthropologist Elizabeth A. Povinelli reflects on a set of ethical and normative claims about the governance of love, sociality, and the body that circulates in liberal settler colonies such as the United States and Australia. She boldly theorizes intimate relations as pivotal sites where liberal logics and aspirations absorbed through settler imperialism are manifest, where discourses of self-sovereignty, social constraint, and value converge. For more than twenty years, Povinelli has traveled to the social worlds of indigenous men and women living at Belyuen, a small community in the Northern Territory of Australia. More recently she has moved across communities of alternative progressive queer movements in the United States, particularly those who identify as radical faeries. In this book she traces how liberal binary concepts of individual freedom and social constraint influence understandings of intimacy in these two worlds. At the same time, she describes alternative models of social relations within each group in order to highlight modes of intimacy that transcend a reductive choice between freedom and constraint. Shifting focus away from identities toward the social matrices out of which identities and divisions emerge, Povinelli offers a framework for thinking through such issues as what counts as sexuality and which forms of intimate social relations result in the distribution of rights, recognition, and resources, and which do not. In The Empire of Love Povinelli calls for, and begins to formulate, a politics of “thick life,” a way of representing social life nuanced enough to meet the density and variation of actual social worlds.",

    "description": "The bestselling author and psychologist whose books have topped 240,000 copies in print now addresses the trait of “high sensitivity” in children–and offers a breakthrough parenting guidebook for highly sensitive children and their caregivers. With the publication of The Highly Sensitive Person, Elaine Aron became the first person to identify the inborn trait of “high sensitivity” and to show how it affects the lives of those who possess it. Up to 20 percent of the population is born highly sensitive, and now in The Highly Sensitive Child, Aron shifts her focus to highly sensitive children, who share the same characteristics as highly sensitive adults and thus face unique challenges as they grow up. Rooted in Aron’s years of experience as a psychotherapist and her original research on child temperament, The Highly Sensitive Child shows how HSCs are born deeply reflective, sensitive to the subtle, and easily overwhelmed. These qualities can make for smart, conscientious, creative children, but with the wrong parenting or schooling, they can become unusually shy or timid, or begin acting out. Few parents and teachers understand where this behavior comes from–and as a result, HSCs are often mislabeled as overly inhibited, fearful, or “fussy,”or classified as “problem children” (and in some cases, misdiagnosed with disorders such as Attention Deficit Disorder). But raised with proper understanding and care, HSCs are no more prone to these problems than nonsensitive children and can grow up to be happy, healthy, well-adjusted adults. In this pioneering work, parents will find helpful self-tests and case studies to help them understand their HSC, along with thorough advice on: • The challenges of raising an highly sensitive child • The four keys to successfully parenting an HSC • How to soothe highly sensitive infants • Helping sensitive children survive in a not-so-sensitive world • Making school and friendships enjoyable With chapters addressing the needs of specific age groups, from newborns through teens, The Highly Sensitive Child delivers warmhearted, timely information for parents, teachers, and the sensitive children in their lives.

    "description": "Challenging conventional wisdom on grief, a pioneering therapist offers a new resource for those experiencing loss When a painful loss or life-shattering event upends your world, here is the first thing to know: there is nothing wrong with grief. “Grief is simply love in its most wild and painful form,” says Megan Devine. “It is a natural and sane response to loss.” So, why does our culture treat grief like a disease to be cured as quickly as possible? In It’s OK That You’re Not OK, Megan Devine offers a profound new approach to both the experience of grief and the way we try to help others who have endured tragedy. Having experienced grief from both sides—as both a therapist and as a woman who witnessed the accidental drowning of her beloved partner—Megan writes with deep insight about the unspoken truths of loss, love, and healing. She debunks the culturally prescribed goal of returning to a normal, “happy” life, replacing it with a far healthier middle path, one that invites us to build a life alongside grief rather than seeking to overcome it. In this compelling and heartful book, you’ll learn: • Why well-meaning advice, therapy, and spiritual wisdom so often end up making it harder for people in grief • How challenging the myths of grief—doing away with stages, timetables, and unrealistic ideals about how grief should unfold—allows us to accept grief as a mystery to be honored instead of a problem to solve • Practical guidance for managing stress, improving sleep, and decreasing anxiety without trying to “fix” your pain • How to help the people you love—with essays to teach us the best skills, checklists, and suggestions for supporting and comforting others through the grieving process Many people who have suffered a loss feel judged, dismissed, and misunderstood by a culture that wants to “solve” grief. Megan writes, “Grief no more needs a solution than love needs a solution.” Through stories, research, life tips, and creative and mindfulness-based practices, she offers a unique guide through an experience we all must face—in our personal lives, in the lives of those we love, and in the wider world. It’s OK That You’re Not OK is a book for grieving people, those who love them, and all those seeking to love themselves—and each other—better.",

    "description": "The Spark is Kristine Barnett's remarkable memoir about being mother to a genius. Kristine Barnett's son Jacob has an IQ higher than Einstein's, a photographic memory, and he taught himself calculus in two weeks. At nine he started working on an original theory in astrophysics that experts believe may someday put him in line for a Nobel Prize, and at age twelve he became a paid researcher in quantum physics. But the story of Kristine's journey with Jake is all the more remarkable because his extraordinary mind was almost lost to autism. At age two, when Jake was diagnosed, Kristine was told he might never be able to tie his own shoes. Dramatic, inspiring, and transformative, The Spark is about the power of love and courage in the face of overwhelming obstacles, and the dazzling possibilities that can occur when we learn how to tap the true potential that lies within every child, and in all of us. 'The Spark is about the transformative power of unconditional love. If you have a child who's 'different' - and who doesn't? - you won't be able to put it down' Sylvia Nasar, author of A Beautiful Mind 'The Spark describes in glowing terms the profound intensity with which a mother can love her child' Andrew Solomon, author of Far from the Tree 'Every parent and teacher should read this fabulous book!' Temple Grandin, author of Thinking in Pictures and co-author of The Autistic Brain Kristine Barnett lives in Indiana with her husband, Michael, and their children. In 1996 she founded Acorn Hill Academy, a daycare serving local families. She and Michael currently run a charitable community centre for autistic and special-needs children and their families called Jacob's Place.",

    "description": "How a company 'positions' a brand is not necessarily how the consumer perceives that brand. Brands allow marketers to add meaning to products and services, but it is consumers who ultimately determine what a brand means. The sources of brand meaning are many and varied, as are the ways in which meanings become attached to brands. Brand Meaning takes a comprehensive and holistic look at how consumers find and create meaning in brands. It explores the fundamental conscious and unconscious elements that connect people with products and brands. Traditional marketing concepts are questioned, and a new brand meaning framework is put forward. The book lays out new and fertile territory for the understanding of how brands can both assimilate and provide meaning. It will leave readers with a better appreciation of what brand means and what brands mean. Primarily intended as a supplemental reader for undergraduate, graduate and MBA courses, the book's scope should also make it rewarding and valuable reading for practitioners in the fields of marketing and advertising.",

    "description": "The #1 New York Times bestseller that examines how people can champion new ideas—and how leaders can fight groupthink, from the author of Give and Take and co-author of Option B “Reading Originals made me feel like I was seated across from Adam Grant at a dinner party, as one of my favorite thinkers thrilled me with his insights and his wonderfully new take on the world.” —Malcolm Gladwell, author of Outliers and The Tipping Point “Originals is one of the most important and captivating books I have ever read, full of surprising and powerful ideas. It will not only change the way you see the world; it might just change the way you live your life. And it could very well inspire you to change your world.” —Sheryl Sandberg, COO of Facebook and author of Lean In With Give and Take, Adam Grant not only introduced a landmark new paradigm for success but also established himself as one of his generation’s most compelling and provocative thought leaders. In Originals he again addresses the challenge of improving the world, but now from the perspective of becoming original: choosing to champion novel ideas and values that go against the grain, battle conformity, and buck outdated traditions. How can we originate new ideas, policies, and practices without risking it all? Using surprising studies and stories spanning business, politics, sports, and entertainment, Grant explores how to recognize a good idea, speak up without getting silenced, build a coalition of allies, choose the right time to act, and manage fear and doubt; how parents and teachers can nurture originality in children; and how leaders can build cultures that welcome dissent. Learn from an entrepreneur who pitches his start-ups by highlighting the reasons not to invest, a woman at Apple who challenged Steve Jobs from three levels below, an analyst who overturned the rule of secrecy at the CIA, a billionaire financial wizard who fires employees for failing to criticize him, and a TV executive who didn’t even work in comedy but saved Seinfeld from the cutting-room floor. The payoff is a set of groundbreaking insights about rejecting conformity and improving the status quo.",

    "title": "A History of Madness in Sixteenth-century Germany",

    ],
    "publisher": "Stanford University Press",
    "publishedDate": "1999",
    "description": "This magisterial work explores how Renaissance Germans understood and experienced madness. It focuses on the insanity of the world in general but also on specific disorders; examines the thinking on madness of theologians, jurists, and physicians; and analyzes the vernacular ideas that propelled sufferers to seek help in pilgrimage or newly founded hospitals for the helplessly disordered. In the process, the author uses the history of madness as a lens to illuminate the history of the Renaissance, the Reformation and Counter-Reformation, the history of poverty and social welfare, and the history of princely courts, state building, and the civilizing process. Rather than try to fit historical experience into modern psychiatric categories, this book reconstructs the images and metaphors through which Renaissance Germans themselves understood and experienced mental illness and deviance, ranging from such bizarre conditions as St. Vitus\u0092s dance and demonic possession to such medical crises as melancholy and mania. By examining the records of shrines and hospitals, where the mad went for relief, we hear the voices of the mad themselves. For many religious Germans, sin was a form of madness and the sinful world was thoroughly insane. This book compares the thought of Martin Luther and the medical-religious reformer Paracelsus, who both believed that madness was a basic category of human experience. For them and others, the sixteenth century was an age of increasing demonic presence; the demon-possessed seemed to be everywhere. For Renaissance physicians, however, the problem was finding the correct ancient Greek concepts to describe mental illness. In medical terms, the late sixteenth century was the age of melancholy. For jurists, the customary insanity defense did not clarify whether melancholy persons were responsible for their actions, and they frequently solicited the advice of physicians. Sixteenth-century Germany was also an age of folly, with fools filling a major role in German art and literature and present at every prince and princeling\u0092s court. The author analyzes what Renaissance Germans meant by folly and examines the lives and social contexts of several court fools.",

    "description": "Il primo libro interamente dedicato alla preadolescenza, raccontata e indagata da due grandi esperti di psicologia dell’età evolutiva, con il rigore scientifico e il tono divulgativo che li ha resi celebri. Tutto è iniziato con l’ingresso alle scuole medie. Fino a ieri vostro figlio era un bambino angelico, e ora di colpo è pronto a darvi battaglia su tutto, pensa solo a divertirsi e vive di emozioni intense e improvvise, come sulle montagne russe. Lo tsunami che vi sta travolgendo si chiama preadolescenza, e sappiate fin da subito che non c’è cura; ma un segreto per sopravvivere, sì: capire cosa sta succedendo in un cervello in piena evoluzione, che funziona in modo diverso rispetto a quello di un adulto. Barbara Tamborini e Alberto Pellai ne sanno qualcosa: esperti di psicologia dell’età evolutiva e genitori di due figli preadolescenti (e di altri due che stanno per diventarlo), sapranno introdurvi alle meraviglie di quest’età e darvi i consigli giusti per ritrovare un canale di comunicazione che vi sembra impossibile. Non solo. Vi aiuteranno anche a guardarvi dentro e a capire che tipo di genitori siete e vorreste diventare, per essere mamme e papà “sufficientemente buoni”, capaci di riflettere sui propri errori e aggiustare il tiro. Senza prendersi troppo sul serio, perché la perfezione non è di questo mondo.",

    "description": "This book traces the development of learning theory in Psychology. Each major theory of the past century is analyzed in detail, and in terms of its evolution from those that preceded it. Theory-building is cumulative, each new idea standing on the shoulders of earlier ones, according to the logical progression of thesis to antithesis to synthesis. On what we learned from the subject of this book, learning, we learned from what was learned before. A classical example of theory developing by trial and error, fits and starts, blind alleys and flashes of insight is the discovery of the DNA molecule. At least three laboratories, in England and America, were closing-in on the answer at the same time, competing with each-other as they reached the finish-line. Each following its governing theory--for instance, Linus Pauling's gamble on a triple helix--the lads from Cambridge won the race, and the rest, as they say, is History. None of the drama of that campaign to find the truth of a natural phenomenon is to be found here, with one exception: the gradual process of one theory morphing into another, on the strength of a new idea, has finally yielded a workable synthesis of how we learn. This result is presented here in precise, simple terms that leave jargon behind.",

Leading experts describe ways to combine motivational interviewing (MI) with other treatments for a wide range of psychological problems, including depression, anxiety disorders, eating disorders, posttraumatic stress disorder, and others. Chapters illustrate the nuts and bolts of intervention, using vivid clinical examples, and review the empirical evidence base. Contributors show how to tailor MI to each population's needs, whether used as a pretreatment or throughout the course of therapy. This book is in the Applications of Motivational Interviewing series, edited by Stephen Rollnick, William R. Miller, and Theresa B. Moyers. New to This Edition *Many new authors. *Extensively revised with the latest theory, practices, and research. *Chapters on domestic violence, addictions, and smoking cessation with adolescents. *Chapter on transdiagnostic treatment.",

    "description": "This book achieves a goal that was set 25 years ago when the HAM theory of human memory was published. This theory reflected one of a number of then-current efforts to create a theory of human cognition that met the twin goals of precision and complexity. Up until then the standard for precision had been the mathematical theories of the 1950s and 1960s. These theories took the form of precise models of specific experiments along with some informal, verbally-stated understanding of how they could be extended to new experiments. They seemed to fall far short of capturing the breadth and power of human cognition that was being demonstrated by the new experimental work in human cognition. The next 10 years saw two major efforts to address the problems of scope. In 1976, the ACT theory was first described and included a production rule system of procedural memory to complement HAM's declarative memory. This provided a computationally adequate system which was indeed capable of accounting for all sorts of cognition. In 1993, a new version of ACT--ACT-R--was published. This was an effort to summarize the theoretical progress made on skill acquisition in the intervening 10 years and to tune the subsymbolic level of ACT-R with the insights of the rational analysis of cognition. Although the appearance of generally-available, full-function code set off a series of events which was hardly planned, it resulted in this book. The catalyst for this was the emergence of a user community. Lebiere insisted that assembling a critical mass of users was essential to the ultimate success of the theory and that a physical gathering was the only way to achieve that goal. This resulted in the First Annual ACT-R Summer School and Workshop, held in 1994. In writing the book, the authors became seized by an aspiration that went beyond just describing the theory correctly. They decided to try to display what the theory could do by collecting together and describing some of its in-house applications. This book reflects decades of work in ACT-R accumulated by many researchers. The chapters are authored by the people that did that particular work. No doubt the reader will be impressed by the scope of the research and the quality of the individual work. Less apparent, but no less important, was the effort that everyone put into achieving the overall consistency and technical integrity of the book. This is the first work in cognitive science to precisely model such a wide range of phenomena with a single theory.",

    "publishedDate": "1995",
    "description": "The first of Erich Neumann's works to be translated into English, this eloquent book draws on a full range of world mythology to show that individual consciousness undergoes the same archetypal stages of development as has human consciousness as a whole. Neumann, one of Jung's most creative students and a renowned practitioner of analytical psychology in his own right, shows how the stages begin and end with the symbol of the Uroboros, or tail-eating serpent. The intermediate stages are projected in the universal myths of the World Creation, Great Mother, Separation of the World Parents, Birth of the Hero, Slaying of the Dragon, Rescue of the Captive, and Transformation and Deification of the Hero. Throughout the sequence the Hero is the evolving ego consciousness\".There can be no doubt that [Neumann] has brought to his task a remarkable . . . knowledge of classical mythology, some considerable acquaintance with the comparative study of religion, and a deep understanding of those psychological views and theories evolved by C. G. Jung\".--The Times Literary Supplement\"A welcome source of information for all those who are touched by the relationship between man and his myths\".--The New York Times\"No better exposition has come to us of the two Jungian themes: the evolution of consciousness in the history of mankind and the development of personality in the individual\".--The PersonalistErich Neumann, born in Berlin in 1905, lived in Tel Aviv from 1934 until his death in 1960. Among his other works in Princeton's Bollingen series are Fear of the Feminine, Amor and Psyche: The Psychic Development of the Feminine, The Great Mother, and The Archetypal World of Henry Moore.",

    "description": "Relational Communication: An Interactional Perspective to the Study of Process and Form brings together in one volume a full treatment of the relational communication perspective on the study of relationships. This perspective takes to heart the formative nature of communication by focusing on the codefined patterns of interaction by which members jointly create their relationship. This book provides a strong theoretical foundation to the research approach and also offers a step-by-step guide for carrying out the research procedures. It is a complete guide for the beginner or experienced researcher. The contributed chapters are written by researchers from psychology, clinical psychology, marital and family therapy, as well as marital, health, and organizational communication. Several of the studies on marital interaction are based on both American and Spanish research samples, offering a cross-disciplinary and cross-cultural application of the perspective. Part I opens with a discussion of the theoretical foundation and epistemological grounding of the perspective and then moves on to the observational research methods involved in applying the perspective's interactional approach. Part II presents a set of programmatic research exemplars that describe the application of the relational communication approach in different relational contexts, from marital to organizational settings. Part III offers a reflective overview of the research perspective. This book is appropriate for advanced undergraduate and graduate students, scholars, and researchers in communication. It will also be of interest to professionals, students, teachers and researchers in the fields of marital relations and family study, social and clinical psychology, family therapy, social work, and marital and family counseling programs.",

    "description": "Crime is a topic that is of considerable interest to policy-makers, politicians and the public alike. We want to know what factors can explain the nature and prevalence of crime in society and use this knowledge to better develop approaches for managing criminal behaviour. This book provides a comprehensive overview of approaches to understanding crime and criminal behaviour, with a focus on psychological perspectives. A wide range of different types of criminal behaviour are considered, including juvenile crime, violent offending, sexual offending, collective violence and drug use. For each type of offence a clear overview of key conceptual and methodological issues is provided, along with a detailed consideration of the major theoretical approaches that have been developed. The book concludes by considering how our theoretical understanding of crime can inform our responses to criminal behaviour in terms of punishment, prevention and rehabilitation. Key features of the book include: • an in-depth coverage of a broad range of different types of criminal behaviour; • inclusion of a diverse range of different theoretical perspectives; • accessibly written, with extensive use of case studies, boxes and activities; • an extensive use of up-to-date references that highlight the current state of knowledge in the field of criminal psychology. This book should be of interest to students, academics, researchers and practitioners with an interest in criminal behaviour, and is particularly suitable for undergraduate courses in criminal psychology, forensic psychology and psychological criminology.",

    "description": "In her #1 New York Times bestsellers, Brené Brown has taught us what it means to dare greatly, rise strong, and brave the wilderness. Now, based on new research conducted with leaders, change makers, and culture shifters, she's showing us how to put those ideas into practice so we can step up and lead. Leadership is not about titles, status, and wielding power. A leader is anyone who takes responsibility for recognizing the potential in people and ideas, and has the courage to develop that potential. When we dare to lead, we don't pretend to have the right answers; we stay curious and ask the right questions. We don't see power as finite and hoard it; we know that power becomes infinite when we share it with others. We don't avoid difficult conversations and situations; we lean into vulnerability when it's necessary to do good work. But daring leadership in a culture defined by scarcity, fear, and uncertainty requires skill-building around traits that are deeply and uniquely human. The irony is that we're choosing not to invest in developing the hearts and minds of leaders at the exact same time as we're scrambling to figure out what we have to offer that machines and AI can't do better and faster. What can we do better? Empathy, connection, and courage, to start. Four-time #1 New York Times bestselling author Brené Brown has spent the past two decades studying the emotions and experiences that give meaning to our lives, and the past seven years working with transformative leaders and teams spanning the globe. She found that leaders in organizations ranging from small entrepreneurial startups and family-owned businesses to nonprofits, civic organizations, and Fortune 50 companies all ask the same question: How do you cultivate braver, more daring leaders, and how do you embed the value of courage in your culture? In this new book, Brown uses research, stories, and examples to answer these questions in the no-BS style that millions of readers have come to expect and love. Brown writes, \"One of the most important findings of my career is that daring leadership is a collection of skills and practices that are 100 percent teachable. It's learning and unlearning that requires brave work, tough conversations, and showing up with your whole heart. Easy? No. Because choosing courage over comfort is not always our default. Worth it? Always. We want to be brave with our lives and our work. It's why we're here.\" Whether you've read Daring Greatly and Rising Strong or you're new to Brené Brown's work, this book is for anyone who wants to step up and into brave leadership.",

    "description": "Human Error, published in 1991, is a major theoretical integration of several previously isolated literatures. Particularly important is the identification of cognitive processes common to a wide variety of error types. Technology has now reached a point where improved safety can only be achieved on the basis of a better understanding of human error mechanisms. In its treatment of major accidents, the book spans the disciplinary gulf between psychological theory and those concerned with maintaining the reliability of hazardous technologies. As such, it is essential reading not only for cognitive scientists and human factors specialists, but also for reliability engineers and risk managers. No existing book speaks with so much clarity to both the theorists and the practitioners of human reliability.",

    "description": "Psychoneuroimmunology investigates the relationships between behavior, psychosocial factors, the nervous, endocrine, and immune systems, and disease. Each system affects the others, enhancing and/or inhibiting processes elsewhere in the body. Research in this field has grown tremendously in recent years as science better understands the checks and balances of these interdisciplinary systems and processes. Introduction to Psychoneuroimmunology provides the first introductory text for this complex field. Beginning with a discussion of immune system basics, Introduction to Psychoneuroimmunology explores endocrine-immune modulation, neuro-immune modulation, the relationship between stress, contextual change, and disease, as well as infection, allergy, immune activity and psychopathology, and immune function enhancement. This text provides a sound introduction to the field and will serve as a valuable overview to what is otherwise a complex interdisciplinary subject at the junction of molecular biology, genetics, the neurosciences, immunology, cell biology, endocrinology, pharmacology, biochemistry, and the behavioral sciences. * Provides a wide coverage of topics * Presents a concise treatment of topics * Includes concluding comments after each chapter * Includes definitions of technical terms",

    "description": "Access the deepest source of inspiration and vision We live in a time of massive institutional failure that manifests in the form of three major divides: the ecological, the social, and the spiritual. Addressing these challenges requires a new consciousness and collective leadership capacity. In this groundbreaking book, Otto Scharmer invites us to see the world in new ways and in so doing discover a revolutionary approach to learning and leadership. In most large systems today, we collectively create results that no one wants. What keeps us stuck in such patterns of the past? It's our blind spot, that is, our lack of awareness of the inner place from which our attention and intention originate. By moving through Scharmer's U process, we consciously access the blind spot and learn to connect to our authentic Self—the deepest source of knowledge and inspiration. Theory U offers a rich diversity of compelling stories, examples, exercises, and practices that allow leaders, organizations, and larger systems to cosense and coshape the future that is wanting to emerge. This second edition features a new preface in which Scharmer identifies five transformational trends and describes U process case stories around the world. There are also eight color drawings by Kelvy Bird that capture U journey applications and illustrate the concepts in the book, as well as new resources for applying the principles and practices.",

    "description": "Since the original publication of this seminal work, acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) has come into its own as a widely practiced approach to helping people change. This book provides the definitive statement of ACT--from conceptual and empirical foundations to clinical techniques--written by its originators. ACT is based on the idea that psychological rigidity is a root cause of a wide range of clinical problems. The authors describe effective, innovative ways to cultivate psychological flexibility by detecting and targeting six key processes: defusion, acceptance, attention to the present moment, self-awareness, values, and committed action. Sample therapeutic exercises and patient-therapist dialogues are integrated throughout. New to This Edition *Reflects tremendous advances in ACT clinical applications, theory building, and research. *Psychological flexibility is now the central organizing focus. *Expanded coverage of mindfulness, the therapeutic relationship, relational learning, and case formulation. *Restructured to be more clinician friendly and accessible; focuses on the moment-by-moment process of therapy.",
