    "description": "This book offers a colorful and penetrating look at African cultural norms and imperatives at the core of African political and economic performance over the past half-century. The author served in five US embassies in Africa and as Assistant Secretary of State for Africa, this provided him with unique opportunities to engage in private conversations with African heads of state. Despite billions of dollars of international development assistance poured into Africa since 1955, and despite huge earnings from commodity sales, Africa has lagged far behind most other emerging nations in economic growth and poverty reduction. Through these conversations, Cohen provides an opportunity to the African leaders he knew to tell us personally why the initial enthusiasm that accompanied independence went so badly awry. A new third generation of African leadership is now coming to the fore. The key question is, can they and the international donor community learn from and overcome the negative legacies of their predecessors? \"Hank Cohen's experience in Africa and access to a wide array of historic African leaders are unparalleled. This unique book provides important lessons from the continent's past and insights for its future.\" -KENNETH L. BROWN, formerly U.S. ambassador to Cote d'Ivoire, Ghana, and Republic of Congo and president, Association for Diplomatic Studies and Training \"That individuals often do make a difference is the thesis of The Mind of the African Strong Man. Based upon his unrivaled experience as an American diplomat in Africa, Hank Cohen's collection of conversations with Africa's Big Men is invaluable to anyone interested in that continent and its tumultuous modern history.\"-- -EDWARD MARKS, Minister-Counselor (ret.), U.S. Foreign Service \"Secretary Cohen is a master storyteller who has made it easier for Africans to form a broad historical perspective through his revealing tales about their rulers.\" -AHMADU ABUBAKER, Nigerian Lawyer active in sub-Saharan Africa development issues.\"",

    "description": "\"Clement Greenberg (1909-94) dominated the American art scene, and is still considered the most influential American art critic of the twentieth century. He almost single-handedly established Jackson Pollock and the Abstract Expressionists at the center of art in the West, and set the tone for art criticism for half a century to come. This biography, based on unpublished and previously unavailable documents, interviews, and archives, presents a story of imagination and grandiosity, of vision and excess.\" \"Alice Goldfarb Marquis presents Greenberg's complex relations with numerous friends, lovers, and rivals, including Pollock, Lee Krasner, Helen Frankenthaler, and Harold Rosenberg. She also recreates the heady art scene in America from the 1940s through the 1980s, detailing how a generation of critics, with Greenberg at the helm, used personal conviction and innate notions of taste to define the course of modern art.\"--BOOK JACKET.",

Tras la fragmentación de esa patria compartida que fue Europa, Zweig la reconstruyó en el único mundo que le era posible, el del espíritu. En esta reconstrucción le ayudaron aquellos autores que fueron sus compañeros de viaje: Montaigne, Chateaubriand, Wassermann, Rilke, Roth... Artistas y amigos que, a modo de herencia, nos lega para inmortalizarlos en el tiempo, para que permanezcan imperecederamente en nuestra conciencia.",

    "description": "Investigating the Teacher's Life and Work attempts to bring together the methodological and substantive aspects of studying the teacher's life and work. Some of the chapters in the book provide a \"how to do\" approach for those wishing to study the teacher's life and work employing a life history method; whilst other chapters provide the kind of substantive and generic findings which might be anticipated when conducting life history work. The focus on professional life and work has been growing rapidly in the last two or three decades. There are a number of reasons for this. Firstly there is a methodological impulse; many new studies are adopting a life history approach. The life history tradition aims to understand the interface between people's life and their work. It also seeks to explore the historical context and the socio-political circumstances in which people's life and work is located. A further major reason for investigating the teacher's life and work at the moment is the huge range of restructuring initiatives taking place throughout the educational world. There is a kind of 'world movement' to restructure education and health - certainly in most Western countries. Generally this takes the form of the introduction of the three T's - targets, tests and tables - and the increasing accountability and performativity regimes associated with these new forms of evaluation. Significantly these initiatives have been introduced at governmental level in most countries with the minimum of consultation with teacher workforces. As a result there is growing evidence of a clash between professional life and work missions and the restructuring initiatives which aim to transform these missions. Perhaps the best way to explore this increasingly acute clash of values is through the investigation of professional life and work. Investigating the Teacher's Life and Work aims to bring together the methodological and substantive approaches and to show how this kind of study can increase our understanding of the interface between government intentions and teacher's beliefs and motives.",

Their subjects range geographically from the British Isles to Bohemia and on to Manchuria and Korea, and chronologically from early medieval Ireland to England in the later twentieth-century. They embrace saints, bishops philosophers, Baptists and Wesleyan Methodists. They bring into one volume St. Patrick Comenius, Defoe, Rousseau, Chivers Jam and the English episcopate's recent past. Those who bring them together include an economic hisotorian, an anthropologist and a historian of thought as well as ecclesiastical historians. They are an invitation to serendipity, but they also allow for a serious making of connexions between unlikely subjects and across disciplines.",

    "description": "In 1999, Stephen King began to write about his craft -- and his life. By midyear, a widely reported accident jeopardized the survival of both. And in his months of recovery, the link between writing and living became more crucial than ever. Rarely has a book on writing been so clear, so useful, and so revealing. On Writing begins with a mesmerizing account of King's childhood and his uncannily early focus on writing to tell a story. A series of vivid memories from adolescence, college, and the struggling years that led up to his first novel, Carrie, will afford readers a fresh and often very funny perspective on the formation of a writer. King next turns to the basic tools of his trade -- how to sharpen and multiply them through use, and how the writer must always have them close at hand. He takes the reader through crucial aspects of the writer's art and life, offering practical and inspiring advice on everything from plot and character development to work habits and rejection. Serialized in the New Yorker to vivid acclaim, On Writing culminates with a profoundly moving account of how King's overwhelming need to write spurred him toward recovery, and brought him back to his life. Brilliantly structured, friendly and inspiring, On Writing will empower--and entertain--everyone who reads it.",

BTS, who rose to fame in their native South Korea in 2013 and who sing almost entirely in Korean, are now a sensation in the US, the UK, Australia and the rest of the world. K-pop is a growing phenomenon in the West. Over the last three years, it's steadily garnered a huge following among social-media-savvy teen girls. With their clean-cut good looks, fabulously choreographed and perfectly executed dance moves, and catchy blend of pop, soft hip hop and RnB, BTS are leading the advance. Extensively researched, and written in an upbeat and accessible style, this book interweaves the success stories of each of the boys with how the band got together, while documenting their amazing rise to fame in Southeast Asia, and then the world. It includes 16 pages of full colour photographs of the band playing live, posing and having fun.",

    "description": "A STORY OF THE POWER OF AN OPEN HEART AND UNCONDITIONAL LOVE... \"...Krause guides readers the way good memoirists must, by rendering with nuance and complexity a story full of the kinds of love and truth that matter for us all.\" Rachel DeWoskin, best-selling author of Bling, Big Girl Small, Repeat After Me, and Foreign Babes in Beijing. \"(Molly) endured loss after loss without ever losing herself, and the qualities that carried her through - equanimity, intelligence, honesty, and a sly sense of humor - are the same ones that distingush her prose in this deeply moving memoir.\" Eric McHenry, 2015-2017 Kansas Poet Laureate \"At 13, Molly Krause spent a summer at the Dance Theatre of Harlem, the only white girl in her class. One teacher called her the 'blue-eyed girl from Kansas.' But nobody is a cliche, especially a person who has spent years coming to an understanding of family matters and how family matters. The matters: divorce, a gay HIV-positive father who dies of AIDS, a sister's suicide attemps, a family struggling with drugs and alcohol. What matters: the honest, direct, sympathetic account the reader finds in Float On, of lives spent yearning to be whole.\" Thomas Fox Averill, Professor Emeritus, Washburn University, author of rode, A Carol Dickens Christmas, and Found Documents from the LIfe of Nell Johnson Doerr. Growing up in Topeka, Kansas in the 1970s, Molly Krause and her family experienced challenges different from the traditional stereotypes of America's Heartland. In this captivating memoir, Krause shares her complex early life with two sisters - the oldest biological and the other an adopted African-American baby. A mother left to raise three young girls when the father revealed he was gay and moved across the country. Struggles in the family with mental illness and substance abuse. A dance talent that was nurtured. A family separated by divorce and distance but brought together by a deadly disease. And through it all, humor, dedication to each other, and a deep love free from judgment.",

    "description": "Family Plots is a fresh and funny autobiographical novel about a young mother trying against all odds to create a normal family life with her new husband, a criminal attorney, who it turns out is committing a few crimes of his own. The novel offers readers a wry, unsentimental account of a marriage barreling toward calamity. In an attempt to find romance, family, and financial stability, its struggling heroine stumbles into a world of pseudonyms, fake weddings, and hidden bank accounts. Events that land many of the players into the family cemetery plot also reveal unexpected secrets and stashes that manage, in small ways, to transform a tale of seeming tragedy into one of surprising healing and redemption. VISIT THE AUTHOR'S WEBSITE AT www.mydreamisdeadbutimnot.com Praise for Family Plots: Mary Patrick Kavanaugh tells her story with such unabashed honesty and rapier-sharp humor that she had me hooked from page one. This is one of those \"you couldn't make this stuff up\" kind of books that makes you think that's awful, while you're laughing out loud at the same time. But beneath the wonderful wit in this dark comedy is a layer of poignancy that takes my breath away. In the end, it's about all the crazy things we do for love. Lolly Winston New York Times Bestselling Author of Good Grief and Happiness Sold Separately [It] reads like a thriller. I honestly couldn't stop thinking about it all the time I was reading it, and finally just took the phone off the hook to finish it. Adair Lara, Author of Hold Me Close, Let Me Go (among others) Family Plots has a great story at its heart: the tension between the longing for security and the longing for excitement, played out in the narrator's romance in which she increasingly sacrifices steady judgment and middle-class dreams to the power of her attraction toward a man whose charm gives him away as a con man and a dreamer. In a subtle way, this story also makes an argument for a compassionate understanding of human imperfection and of the possibility of healing, in small ways, our sins against one another. Catherine Brady, Author of Curled in the Bed of Love and The End of Class War",

    "description": "Ernest Sirluck's life has been full of passion and, not infrequently, conflict. His childhood and youth as a Jew in a predominantly Mennonite Prairie village, his service as a divisional intelligence officer in Europe during the Second World War, and his experience as a professor and university administrator during a period of dramatic changes produced a man of firm convictions and the ability to fight for them. His story charts his many battles: against antisemitism and Nazism, mediocrity and academic complacency, ideological zealotry, and government and union encroachment on university autonomy. But he is, first and foremost, an educator, and his autobiography provides an intimate intellectual history of mid-century universities, spiced with anecdotes about the many prominent educators he worked with, among them E.K. Brown, A.S.P. Woodhouse, Northrop Frye, and Marshall McLuhan.",

    "description": "The Girl Who Could Dance in Outer Space is the second book in The Girls Who Could Series. It tells the tale of young Mae Jemison, the creative girl who became a doctor, an engineer, a dancer, and an astronaut. Mae Jemison teaches us that art and science are natural expressions of creativity and imagination. Nurture them both, and go where your dreams take you! The Girls Who Could is a fun, colorful series of stories about real women who have made a difference in the world through inspired action. By giving young girls examples of people who have done big, amazing things, children grow up with a template of achievement upon which to grow and expand their own dreams and goals. Praise for The Girl Who Could Talk to Computers: \"Love love love this book! It is perfect for my small neice, who is always building and doing puzzles -- I can't wait for more books from this authors for kids.\" \"This book is a huge hit at home with at my toy store. Kids love the simple, bright pictures. Grown-ups love the intelligently written rhymes that get across the main message and accomplishments of Grace Hopper's innovative life, without boring or confusing the children. There are sixteen, 4-line stanzas, each accompanied by an illustration. The book is perfect for young kids that are just starting to read, and I really like how it is geared towards inspiring girls, yet the drawings and story is not pink and frilly, so it can just as easily be read to boys, too. The main message of the book is that when you use your head \"nothing's impossible, you can do it, you bet!\"\"",

    "description": "Axl Rose is one of rock's most colourful figures and yet his story has never been properly told until now. Mick Wall knew the original line up of Guns N' Roses before they were famous and has interviewed them many times. Drawing on exclusive unpublished material he has written a no-holds barred study of the turbulent life and career of the group's singer and leader. Wall describes Axl's difficult childhood in Indiana and how, after escaping to LA he and his fledgling band struggled to survive until they were signed up by Geffen in 1986. The first album Appetite for Destruction turned them into stars but the band's lurid lifestyle took its toll - they embarked on a two-year tour that sounded the death knell for the original line-up. As their lives slipped out of control, the original members bar Axl all left. Axl himself turned into an increasingly reclusive figure. For the past thirteen years he has been working on a long-awaited album, Chinese Democracy, and finally in 2006 re-emerged into public view as the lastest Gun N' Roses line-up embarked on a world tour. Scrupulously researched and vividly written, W. Axl Rose is an explosive biography of rock's biggest living legend.",

His reign lasted a mere twenty-six months, and he was only thirty-three years of age when he was killed at the Battle of Bosworth. Despite this short career he is one of the best known of English monarchs, and one of the most vilified. He has been accused of a number of atrocious crimes, including the murder of his brother and his wife as well as political rivals, culminating in the murder of his nephews, the \"Princes in the Tower\". This book tells the story of his life in a way that has never been told before -- from the personal and official documents written during his lifetime. - Jacket flap.",

    "description": "Former South African president Thabo Mbeki is a complex figure. He was a committed young Marxist who, while in power, embraced conservative economic policies and protected white corporate interests; a rational and dispassionate thinker who was particularly sensitive to criticism and dissent; and a champion of African self-reliance who relied excessively on foreign capital. As a key liberation leader in exile, he was instrumental in the ANC's antiapartheid struggle. Later, he helped build one of the world's most respected constitutional democracies. As president, though, he was unable to overcome inherited socioeconomic challenges, and his disastrous AIDS policies will remain a major blotch on his legacy. Mbeki is the most important African political figure of his generation. He will be remembered as a foreign policy president for his peacemaking efforts and his role in building continental institutions, not least of which was the African Union. In this concise biography, ideally suited for the classroom, Adekeye Adebajo seeks to illuminate Mbeki's contradictions and situate him in a pan-African pantheon.",

Cotton was a platoon leader with the storied 3rd U.S. Infantry Regiment -- The Old Guard -- between combat tours in Iraq and Afghanistan. At the height of the Iraq Surge, he carried the flag-draped remains of his fallen comrades off of airplanes at Dover Air Force Base, and he laid them to rest in Arlington's famed Section 60, \"the saddest acre in America.\" He also performed hundreds of funerals for veterans of the Greatest Generation, as well as the Korean and Vietnam Wars. The Old Guard has embodied the ideals of honor and sacrifice across our nation's history. America's oldest active-duty regiment, dating back to 1784, The Old Guard conducts daily military-honor funerals on the 624 rolling acres of Arlington, where generations of American heroes rest. Its soldiers hold themselves to the standard of perfection in sweltering heat, frigid cold, and driving rain. Every funeral is a no-fail, zero-defect mission, whether honoring a legendary general or a humble private. In researching and writing the book, Cotton returned to Arlington and shadowed the regiment's soldiers, from daily funerals to the state funeral of President George H. W. Bush to the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, reliving the honor -- and the challenges -- of duty at the nation's \"most sacred shrine.\" Part history of The Old Guard, part memoir of Cotton's time at Arlington, part intimate profile of the today's soldiers, Sacred Duty is an unforgettable testament to the timeless power of service and sacrifice to our nation.",
