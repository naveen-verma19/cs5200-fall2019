    "description": "An all-volunteer force, the U.S. military faces a decreasing eligible recruitment population due to declining health, declining education, and increasing criminal history. This thesis examines one aspect that currently affects sufficient force capacity for the Army: the increasing number of individuals with an ADHD diagnosis. Currently, in the United States under DoD policy, individuals with an ADHD diagnosis can, in some cases, serve their country, but just as long as they have not leveraged any of the evidence-based core treatments for ADHD. Increasingly, scholarship points to the benefits rather than the stigma of the neurodivergent population at large, including those with ADHD. Both other militaries and the private sector specifically recruit neurodiverse individuals, including the Israeli Defense Forces, which has created unit 9900, where neurodivergent individuals can and do benefit their country. This thesis suggests alternative insights that individuals with ADHD offer unique abilities that are best suited for military service and can be leveraged in emerging jobs, and further diversify the Army. The thesis presents a detailed literature review, subjective narratives from two current soldiers, and a comprehensive analysis that includes a Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats (S.W.O.T.) analysis, as well as recommendations for future research.This compilation includes a reproduction of the 2019 Worldwide Threat Assessment of the U.S. Intelligence Community.I.

Providing a unified perspective on different design methods and approaches, from the most classic (systematic design) to the most advanced (C-K theory), it offers a unique and integrated presentation of traditional and contemporary theories in the field. Examining the principles of each theory, this guide utilizes numerous real life industrial applications, with clear links to engineering design, industrial design, management, economics, psychology and creativity. Containing a section of exams with detailed answers, it is useful for courses in design theory, engineering design and advanced innovation management. \"Students and professors, practitioners and researchers in diverse disciplines, interested in design, will find in this book a rich and vital source for studying fundamental design methods and tools as well as the most advanced design theories that work in practice\". Professor Yoram Reich, Tel Aviv University, Editor-in-Chief, Research In Engineering Design. \"Twenty years of research in design theory and engineering have shown that training in creative design is indeed possible and offers remarkably operational methods - this book is indispensable for all leaders and practitioners who wish to strengthen theinnovation capacity of their company.\" Pascal Daloz, Executive Vice President, Dassault Systèmes",

They are each oriented toward contemporary empirical studies. The book focuses on foundational issues, including paradoxes, fallacies, and debates about the nature of rationality, the traditional modes of reasoning, as well as counterfactual and causal reasoning. It also includes chapters on the interface between reasoning and other forms of thought. In general, this last set of essays represents growth points in reasoning research, drawing connections to pragmatics, cross-cultural studies, emotion and evolution.",

    "description": "The Austro-American psychoanalyst Heinz Kohut was one of the foremost leaders in his field and developed the school of self-psychology, which sets aside the Freudian explanations for behavior and looks instead at self/object relationships and empathy in order to shed light on human behavior. In How Does Analysis Cure? Kohut presents the theoretical framework for self-psychology, and carefully lays out how the self develops over the course of time. Kohut also specifically defines healthy and unhealthy cases of Oedipal complexes and narcissism, while investigating the nature of analysis itself as treatment for pathologies. This in-depth examination of “the talking cure” explores the lesser studied phenomena of psychoanalysis, including when it is beneficial for analyses to be left unfinished, and the changing definition of “normal.” An important work for working psychoanalysts, this book is important not only for psychologists, but also for anyone interested in the complex inner workings of the human psyche.",

Dabei wurden die Modelle, Theorien und die Übersicht über empirische Arbeiten aktualisiert; integrative Modelle und viele Querverweise zielen auf die im Fach wichtige Integration von volitionaler und motivationaler Perspektive ab. Auch die neuen evolutions- und biopsychologischen Perspektiven werden ausführlich behandelt. Neu in der 3. Auflage ist auch die lernfreundliche Didaktik: Hervorgehobene Schlüsselbegriffe und Kapitelzusammenfassungen, Anwendungsbeispiele aus Schule, Arbeitsleben, Familie und Freizeit, Boxen mit klassischen oder originellen Studien sowie Fragen und Antworten zur Wissensüberprüfung. \"Motivation und Handeln\" liefert somit in der Neuauflage einen umfassenden und lebendigen Überblick über den derzeitigen Stand der Motivationsforschung. Für den Psychologie-Studenten im Grundstudium ist dieses Lehrbuch ein Studienbegleiter; für Fortgeschrittene, Lehrende und Forscher hat es sich als Handbuch und Nachschlagewerk bewährt.",

The field of intelligence is lively on many fronts, and this volume provides full coverage on topics such as behavior-genetic models, evolutionary models, cognitive models, emotional intelligence, practical intelligence, and group difference. Handbook of Intelligence is largely expanded, covering areas such as animal and artificial intelligence, as well as human intelligence. It fully reflects important theoretical progress made since the early 1980s.",

    "description": "Henry Jenkins at Authors@Google (video) Henry Jenkins“s pioneering work in the early 1990s promoted the idea that fans are among the most active, creative, critically engaged, and socially connected consumers of popular culture and that they represent the vanguard of a new relationship with mass media. Though marginal and largely invisible to the general public at the time, today, media producers and advertisers, not to mention researchers and fans, take for granted the idea that the success of a media franchise depends on fan investments and participation. Bringing together the highlights of a decade and a half of groundbreaking research into the cultural life of media consumers, Fans, Bloggers, and Gamers takes readers from Jenkins's progressive early work defending fan culture against those who would marginalize or stigmatize it, through to his more recent work, combating moral panic and defending Goths and gamers in the wake of the Columbine shootings. Starting with an interview on the current state of fan studies, this volume maps the core theoretical and methodological issues in Fan Studies. It goes on to chart the growth of participatory culture on the web, take up blogging as perhaps the most powerful illustration of how consumer participation impacts mainstream media, and debate the public policy implications surrounding participation and intellectual property.",

This eloquently written book includes discussions of Arendt's neglected early text on Rahel Varnhagen, her confrontation with German Existenz philosophy and Zionist politics, Arendt's theory of totalitarianism, and the paradoxes of the rights of man. Hannah Arendt's political thought anticipates some of the major preoccupations of today's identity politics, from gender to nationalism and ethnicit",

    "description": "\"An important reference to students, researchers, and practitioners.\"—Booklist The definitive reference in child psychology and development The acclaimed Handbook of Child Psychology, Fifth Edition spans the entire field of child development. Since the First Edition reached the shelves more than six decades ago, the Handbook has been child psychology?s definitive sourcebook, encyclopedia, and research review guide. The four volumes comprising the Fifth Edition offer in-depth coverage of every social, emotional, perceptual, moral, cognitive, linguistic, and applied aspect of child psychology. Whether you are a practitioner in human development, psychology, sociology, anthropology, or cognitive sciences; or an educator, policymaker, parent, or student, the Handbook of Child Psychology, Fifth Edition is a must-have reference. Praise for the Fifth Edition: \"Without a doubt, [the editors] have successfully carried on the tradition of summarizing what is the most important subfield of the behavioral sciences in an authoritative, comprehensive, and timely fashion. The series editor and volume editors have assembled the best individuals to write for the volumes. . . . For the future generations of developmentalists, these chapters will serve as a time capsule of sorts that accurately documents the status and nature of developmental and child psychology at the turn of the millennium.\"—Child Development Abstracts & Bibliography \"Now in its fifth edition, this handbook should still be considered a standard reference work in the field of developmental psychology. It reflects previously established scholarly traditions of utilizing editors who are renowned in their areas of expertise. It has evolved into a useful tool for undergraduates, graduates, practitioners, and researchers, and provides authoritative coverage and in-depth analysis of both theoretical and practical topics.\" —American Reference Books Annual",

    "description": "This lively introduction to figurative language explains a broad range of concepts, including metaphor, metonymy, simile, and blending, and develops new tools for analyzing them. It coherently grounds the linguistic understanding of these concepts in basic cognitive mechanisms such as categorization, frames, mental spaces, and viewpoint; and it fits them into a consistent framework which is applied to cross-linguistic data and also to figurative structures in gesture and the visual arts. Comprehensive and practical, the book includes analyses of figurative uses of both word meanings and linguistic constructions. • Provides definitions of major concepts • Offers in-depth analyses of examples, exploring multiple levels of complexity • Surveys figurative structures in different discourse genres • Helps students to connect figurative usage with the conceptual underpinnings of language • Goes beyond English to explore cross-linguistic and cross-modal data",

    "description": "Sex in Cyberspace offers a bold and provocative, yet sensitively written, account of an under-investigated area of sociological enquiry. While there is a considerable amount of research documenting the experiences of sex workers, very little data exists on their male clientele. The first empirically-based volume on the experiences of men who pay for sex, this work presents a significant new source of data. The book is based upon an extensive study of on-line forums in which both the purchasers of sexual services and the workers themselves can exchange information and views - information which is otherwise extremely difficult to obtain. Sarah Earle and Keith Sharp argue that such sites represent a significant change in the social organization of sex work and those who seek and use the services of sex workers. Shedding new light on men's sexual identity, Sex in Cyberspace makes a major contribution to the study of sexuality.",
