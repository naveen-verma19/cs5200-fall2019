    "description": "When Althea Leary abandons her nine-year-old son, Jasper, he's left on his uncle's farm with nothing but a change of clothes and a Bible. It's 1952, and Jasper isn't allowed to ask questions or make a fuss. He's lucky to even have a home and must keep his mouth shut and his ears open to stay in his uncle's good graces. No one knows where his mother went or whether she's coming back. Desperate to see her again, he must take matters into his own hands. From the farm, he embarks on a treacherous search that will take him to the squalid hideaways of Detroit and back again, through tawdry taverns, peep shows, and gambling houses. As he's drawn deeper into an adult world of corruption, scandal, and murder, Jasper uncovers the shocking past still chasing his mother--and now it's chasing him too.",

    "description": "#1 New York Times bestselling author Sarah J. Maas launches her brand-new CRESCENT CITY series with House of Earth and Blood: the story of half-Fae and half-human Bryce Quinlan as she seeks revenge in a contemporary fantasy world of magic, danger, and searing romance. Half-Fae, half-human Bryce Quinlan loves her life. By day, she works for an antiquities dealer, selling barely legal magical artifacts, and by night, she parties with her friends, savoring every pleasure Lunathion-otherwise known as Crescent City-has to offer. But it all comes crumbling down when a ruthless murder shakes the very foundations of the city-and Bryce's world. Two years later, her job has become a dead end, and she now seeks only blissful oblivion in the city's most notorious nightclubs. But when the murderer attacks again, Bryce finds herself dragged into the investigation and paired with an infamous Fallen angel whose own brutal past haunts his every step. Hunt Athalar, personal assassin for the Archangels, wants nothing to do with Bryce Quinlan, despite being ordered to protect her. She stands for everything he once rebelled against and seems more interested in partying than solving the murder, no matter how close to home it might hit. But Hunt soon realizes there's far more to Bryce than meets the eye-and that he's going to have to find a way to work with her if they want to solve this case. As Bryce and Hunt race to untangle the mystery, they have no way of knowing the threads they tug ripple through the underbelly of the city, across warring continents, and down to the darkest levels of Hel, where things that have been sleeping for millennia are beginning to stir... With unforgettable characters and page-turning suspense, this richly inventive new fantasy series by #1 New York Times bestselling author Sarah J. Maas delves into the heartache of loss, the price of freedom-and the power of love.",

    "description": "A SUNDAY TIMES TOP TEN BESTSELLER Selected as a summer read by the Independent, Grazia, Vogue, Cosmopolitan and ES Magazine 'Glamorous, sexy, compelling ... Addictive ... Radical and refreshing to read' DOLLY ALDERTON, SUNDAY TIMES 'A masterpiece' Evening Standard It is the summer of 1940. Nineteen-year-old Vivian Morris arrives in New York with her suitcase and sewing machine, exiled by her despairing parents. Although her quicksilver talents with a needle and commitment to mastering the perfect hair roll have been deemed insufficient for her to pass into her sophomore year of Vassar, she soon finds gainful employment as the self-appointed seamstress at the Lily Playhouse, her unconventional Aunt Peg's charmingly disreputable Manhattan revue theatre. There, Vivian quickly becomes the toast of the showgirls, transforming the trash and tinsel only fit for the cheap seats into creations for goddesses. Exile in New York is no exile at all: here in this strange wartime city of girls, Vivian and her girlfriends mean to drink the heady highball of life itself to the last drop. And when the legendary English actress Edna Watson comes to the Lily to star in the company's most ambitious show ever, Vivian is entranced by the magic that follows in her wake. But there are hard lessons to be learned, and bitterly regrettable mistakes to be made. Vivian learns that to live the life she wants, she must live many lives, ceaselessly and ingeniously making them new. 'At some point in a woman's life, she just gets tired of being ashamed all the time. After that, she is free to become whoever she truly is,' she confides. And so Vivian sets forth her story, and that of the women around her – women who have lived as they truly are, out of step with a century that could never quite keep up with them.",

    "description": "Reyna knows her relationship with Boyd isn't perfect, yet as she visits him throughout his three-month stint in prison, their bond grows tighter. Kiki, now settled in New York after a journey that took her to Turkey and around the world, admires her niece's spirit but worries that she always picks the wrong man. Little does she know that the otherwise honourable Boyd is pulling Reyna into a scheme which violates his probation. When Reyna ultimately decides to remove herself for the sake of her four-year-old child, her small act of resistance sets into motion a tapestry of events that affect the lives of loved ones and strangers around them. A novel that examines conviction, connection and the possibility of generosity in the face of loss, Improvement is as intricately woven together as Kiki's beloved Turkish rugs and as colourful as the tattoos decorating Reyna's body, with narrative twists and turns as surprising and unexpected as the lives all around us. The Boston Globe says of Joan Silber 'No other writer can make a few small decisions ripple across the globe, and across time, with more subtlety and power.' Improvement is Silber's most shining achievement yet.",

    "description": "An unprecedented and terrifying bioterrorism plot threatens to kill millions in the midst of a divisive presidential election in this new thriller from the #1 New York Times bestselling Mitch Rapp series. A toxic presidential election is underway in an America already badly weakened by internal divisions. While politicians focus entirely on maintaining their own power and privilege, ISIS kidnaps a brilliant French microbiologist and forces him to begin manufacturing anthrax. Slickly produced videos chronicling his progress and threatening an imminent attack are posted to the Internet, intensifying the hysteria gripping the US. ISIS recruits a Mexican drug cartel to smuggle the bioweapon across the border, but it’s really just a diversion. The terrorist organization needs to keep Mitch Rapp and Irene Kennedy distracted long enough to weaponize a deadly virus that they stumbled upon in Yemen. If they succeed, they’ll trigger a pandemic that could rewrite the world order. Rapp embarks on a mission to infiltrate the Mexican cartels and track down the ISIS leader who he failed to kill during their last confrontation. But with Washington’s political elite increasingly lined up against him, he knows he’ll be on his own. “In the world of black-ops thrillers, Mitch Rapp remains the gold standard” (Booklist, starred review).",

    "description": "'I don't think I could ever love a man so dearly that I would go against my parents' will for his sake.' Set in fourteenth-century Norway, The Wreathbegins the life story of Kristin Lavransdatter. Starting with Kristin's childhood and continuing through her romance with Erlend Nikulausson, a dangerously charming and impetuous man, Sigrid Undset re-creates the historical backdrop in vivid detail, immersing readers in the day-to-day life, Social conventions, and political undercurrents of the period. But the story she tells is a modern one, brought to life with clarity and lyrical beauty in this remarkable translation by Tiina Nunnally. Defying her parents and stubbornly pursuing her own happiness, Kristin emerges as a woman who loves with power and passion. 'A masterpiece . . . writing in a prose as vigorous, articulate and naturalistic as the novel it re-creates, Tiina Nunnally brilliantly captures a world both remote and strangely familiar.' -PEN/Book-of-the-Month Club Translation Prize citation",

    "description": "Nobel prize winner and author of One Hundred Years of Solitude Gabriel Garcia Marquez tells a tale of an unrequited love that outlasts all rivals in his masterpiece Love in the Time of Cholera. 'It was inevitable: the scent of bitter almonds always reminded him of the fate of unrequited love' Fifty-one years, nine months and four days have passed since Fermina Daza rebuffed hopeless romantic Florentino Ariza's impassioned advances and married Dr Juvenal Urbino instead. During that half-century, Florentino has fallen into the arms of many delighted women, but has loved none but Fermina. Having sworn his eternal love to her, he lives for the day when he can court her again. When Fermina's husband is killed trying to retrieve his pet parrot from a mango tree, Florentino seizes his chance to declare his enduring love. But can young love find new life in the twilight of their lives? 'The most important writer of fiction in any language' Bill Clinton 'An exquisite writer, wise, compassionate and extremely funny' Sunday Telegraph 'An amazing celebration of the many kinds of love between men and women' The Times",

    "description": "'Powerful . . . A twisting tale of love, loss, and dark family secrets' Paula Hawkins, #1 New York Times bestselling author of The Girl on the Train and Into the Water It begins with a mystery. Sylvie, the beautiful, brilliant, successful older daughter of the Lee family, flies to the Netherlands for one final visit with her dying grandmother - and then vanishes. Amy, the sheltered baby of the Lee family, is too young to remember a time when her parents were newly immigrated and too poor to keep Sylvie. Seven years older, Sylvie was raised by a distant relative in a faraway, foreign place, and didn't rejoin her family in America until age nine. Timid and shy, Amy has always looked up to her sister, the fierce and fearless protector who showered her with unconditional love. But what happened to Sylvie? Amy and her parents are distraught and desperate for answers. Sylvie has always looked out for them. Now, it's Amy's turn to help. Terrified yet determined, Amy retraces her sister's movements, flying to the last place Sylvie was seen. But instead of simple answers, she discovers something much more valuable: the truth. Sylvie, the golden girl, kept painful secrets . . . secrets that will reveal more about Amy's complicated family - and herself - than she ever could have imagined. A deeply moving story of family, secrets, identity, and longing, Searching for Sylvie Lee is both a gripping page-turner and a sensitive portrait of an immigrant family. It is a profound exploration of the many ways culture and language can divide us and the impossibility of ever truly knowing someone - especially those we love.",

In a quest for a simpler life, Helen and Nate abandon the comforts of suburbia and their teaching jobs to take up residence on forty-four acres of rural land where they will begin the ultimate, aspirational do-it-yourself project: building the house of their dreams. When they discover that this charming property has a dark and violent past, Helen, a former history teacher, becomes consumed by the legend of Hattie Breckenridge, a woman who lived and died there a century ago. As Helen starts carefully sourcing decorative building materials for her home--wooden beams, mantles, historic bricks--she starts to unearth, and literally conjure, the tragic lives of Hattie's descendants, three generations of \"Breckenridge women,\" each of whom died amidst suspicion, and who seem to still be seeking something precious and elusive in the present day.",

    "description": "Quanto coraggio ci vuole per tener stretto l’amore, anche quando fa male? Quanto coraggio ci vuole per rialzarsi dopo l’ennesima caduta? Quanto coraggio ci vuole per stare al fianco di un amico mentre il mondo gli crolla addosso? Quanto coraggio ci vuole per sedersi davanti a un tramonto, spingere lo sguardo oltre la linea dell’orizzonte e capire che chiunque può superare i propri limiti, chiunque può essere infinito? E per imparare ad amarsi, fregandosene dei giudizi altrui, saltando fuori dalla gabbia che hai intorno, quanto coraggio ci vuole? Lorenzo e Marzia sono amici da poco, uniti dalla musica, quella che lui suona da sempre, per passione e per mettere insieme uno stipendio, e che per lei fa parte del regalo di compleanno che sta preparando per Riccardo, l’amore della sua vita. Hanno storie diverse, Lorenzo e Marzia: lui ha trentasette anni, è nato in una periferia popolare ma vive in un palazzo elegante del centro di Roma, con la sua bellissima moglie Ginevra e una splendida bambina di tre anni e mezzo, per la quale farebbe qualunque cosa; Marzia di anni ne ha diciotto, si è appena trasferita con la famiglia alla Garbatella, trovando nuove compagne con cui condividere le emozioni più forti, compresa la paura per l’esame di maturità. Rompendo ogni schema e con la tenerezza dirompente delle vere amicizie, loro e un gruppo fantastico di persone pronte in ogni momento ad aiutarle affronteranno un’estate destinata a cambiare tutto, attraverso cadute dolorose, altalene di dubbi, errori inattesi e momenti di irrefrenabile gioia. Con la voglia di credere nell’amore, sempre, a qualunque costo, e di urlare al mondo la magia di un bacio, la poesia di un sorriso, la bellezza dei propri sogni! «Ha una sincerità disarmante. Mentre parla traspare una genuinità che mette a disagio.» - Flavia Piccinni, Huffington Post «Credo che Roberto ci racconti, con una lingua sconosciuta a molti, ancora in formazione, da definire, cioè nuova, i vecchi sentimenti di sempre che agitano le nostre vite e rendono fragili i nostri cuori.» - Mimmo Calopresti «Parla d’amore con un linguaggio semplice ma profondo.» - La Nazione «I critici continuano a snobbarlo. Non si chiedono nemmeno come sia possibile che nell’era dei Social uno scrittore appena quarantenne faccia vendere così tanti libri di carta. Come riesca questo strano connubio, quasi una “riconciliazione”, tra virtuale e reale. Lui non se ne cura e preferisce continuare a usare il “noi”.» - Alberto Di Majo, Il Tempo «Intorno ai suoi romanzi è nata una vasta comunità di lettori. Agguerrita, ma non bellicosa. Online, ma anche fisica. Animata da buoni sentimenti, sostegno reciproco, incoraggiamenti nella vita e nell’amore. Quasi una religione.» - Corriere della Sera",

Je ne voulais plus voir personne. Mais j'ai survécu. Contre toute attente, j'ai fini par surmonter l'insurmontable et, petit à petit, la vie m'a paru vivable. » Paris, 1916. Sophie Lefèvre doit prendre soin de sa famille alors que son mari part pour le front. Quand la ville tombe aux mains de l'armée allemande, au milieu de la Première Guerre mondiale, Sophie est contrainte de faire le service tous les soirs à l'hôtel où résident le nouveau commandant et ses hommes. À l'instant où le nouveau commandant découvre le portrait qu'Édouard a fait de sa femme, naît une dangereuse obsession qui menace la réputation, la famille et la vie de Sophie, et va la conduire à prendre une terrible décision. Un siècle plus tard, à Londres, Liv reçoit ce portrait en cadeau de la part de son mari avant de recueillir son dernier soupir. Sa vie est bouleversée lorsqu'une rencontre de hasard lui permet de découvrir la véritable histoire de ce tableau. « Bouleversant. » People « Un conte poignant sur la face cachée des plus grandes histoires d'amour. » - Entertainment Weekly « Moyes imagine toujours des histoires savoureuses dont les personnages prennent vie entre les pages. Une histoire merveilleuse sur le pouvoir libérateur de l'art et de l'amour. » - USA Today « Le lecteur est tenu en haleine jusqu'à la dernière page dans cette ode splendide à l'audace et à la volonté. » - Los Angeles Times « Un incomparable talent de conteuse. » - New York Daily News « Ce roman ne fait que confirmer le talent de Jojo Moyes. Comme dans Avant toi, elle invite ses lecteurs à considérer sous un jour nouveau des choix moraux d'une grande complexité. Un roman puissant, provocant et incroyablement bien mené. » - The Washington Post « La prose de Jojo Moyes est si limpide qu'on imagine sans peine le portrait vieux d'un siècle qui est au cœur de son roman. Une histoire d'amour d'une beauté peu commune. » - Booklist « Liv et Sophie sont plus vraies que nature avec leurs failles, leur passion et leur courage qu'on se laisse happer par leur destin de la première à la dernière page. Un livre dont on ne fait qu'une bouchée ! » - Library Journal Mot de l'éditeur : Jojo Moyes n'écrit pas seulement des best-sellers, elle écrit des livres qui vous accompagnent dans la vie.

    "description": "1984, published in 1949, is a dystopian and satirical novel. It revolves around Winston Smith, who lives in a nation called Oceania, in a province called Airstrip One, which represents present-day England. This state is controlled by the Party, headed by a mysterious leader who is addressed as Emmanuel Goldstein, also known as the Big Brother. The Party watches every single move that Smith and other citizens make. The nation’s language and history is forcefully changed for the benefit of the Party. A new language, Newspeak, is being compulsively implemented to ensure works that have anything to do with political rebellion are omitted. In Oceania, even rebellious thoughts are illegal and are said to be the worst of all crimes. The people are suppressed and any form of individuality is not tolerated, including love and sex. Smith works as a low-ranking member of the Party who alters historical records. He hates the Party and thus buys an illegal diary in which he pens down his thoughts. He meets Julia, a coworker, who seems to been romantically inclined towards him. He however doubts that she is a Party spy who will get him imprisoned for his ‘thoughtcrimes’. Her love turns out to be true and they have a covert affair. Smith’s hatred for the Party grows day by day and he is convinced that a powerful Party official O’Brien is actually trying to overthrow the present government with the help of a secret group named the Brotherhood. As the story goes on, readers learn the twists and turns that life in Oceania has in store for Smith. He faces terror, betrayal, freedom, and a broken spirit. 1984 is the author’s haunting vision of the future. The book has been adapted into television programmes, films, radio broadcasts and plays. In 2003, the book was number 8 on BBC’s survey The Big Read. It was 6th and 13th on the reader’s and editor’s list of Modern Library 100 Best Novels, respectively. In 2005, it was added to the 100 Best English Language Novel from 1923 to 2005 by TIME magazine.",

    "description": "One beautiful September day, three sixty-six-year old men convene on Martha's Vineyard, friends ever since meeting in college in the sixties. They couldn't have been more different then, or even today - Lincoln's a commercial real estate broker, Teddy a tiny-press publisher, and Mickey a musician beyond his rockin' age. But each man holds his own secrets, in addition to the monumental mystery that none of them has ever stopped puzzling over since a Memorial Day weekend right here on the Vineyard in 1971. Now, forty-four years later, as this new weekend unfolds, three lives and that of a significant other are displayed in their entirety while the distant past confounds the present like a relentless squall of surprise and discovery. Shot through with Russo's trademark comedy and humanity, Chances Are ... also introduces a new level of suspense and menace that will quicken the reader's heartbeat throughout this absorbing saga of how friendship's bonds are every bit as constricting and rewarding as those of family or any other community. For both longtime fans and lucky newcomers, Chances Are ... is a stunning demonstration of a highly acclaimed author deepening and expanding his remarkable achievement.",

In a matter of days, Willie dies and is laid to rest in a Georgetown cemetery. Newspapers report that a grief-stricken Lincoln returns to the crypt several times alone to hold his boy's body. From this seed of historical truth, George Saunders spins an unforgettable story of familial love and loss that breaks free of realism, entering a thrilling, supernatural domain both hilarious and terrifying. Willie Lincoln finds himself trapped in a transitional realm - called, in Tibetan tradition, the bardo - and as ghosts mingle, squabble, gripe and commiserate, and stony tendrils creep towards the boy, a monumental struggle erupts over young Willie's soul. Unfolding over a single night, Lincoln in the Bardo is written with George Saunders' inimitable humour, pathos and grace. Here he invents an exhilarating new form, and is confirmed as one of the most important and influential writers of his generation. Deploying a theatrical, kaleidoscopic panoply of voices - living and dead, historical and fictional - Lincoln in the Bardo poses a timeless question: how do we live and love when we know that everything we hold dear must end?",

SUNDAY EXPRESS 'Charming and tender, a complete joy.' SUNDAY MIRROR 'Perfectly crafted, a beautiful, gripping account of Irish memory and deceit. A terrific achievement.' ANDREW O'HAGAN From the bestselling author of Holding comes a masterly tale of secrets and ill-fated loves set on the coast of Ireland. Dear Lonely Leinster Lady, I'm not really sure how to begin . . . The truth drifts out to sea, riding the waves out of sight. And then the tide turns. Elizabeth Keane returns to Ireland after her mother's death, intent only on wrapping up that dismal part of her life. There is nothing here for her; she wonders if there ever was. The house of her childhood is stuffed full of useless things, her mother's presence already fading. And perhaps, had she not found the small stash of letters, the truth would never have come to light. 40 years earlier, a young woman stumbles from a remote stone house, the night quiet but for the tireless wind that circles her as she hurries further into the darkness away from the cliffs and the sea. She has no sense of where she is going, only that she must keep on. This compelling new novel confirms Graham Norton's status as a fresh, literary voice, bringing his clear-eyed understanding of human nature and its darkest flaws.",

    "description": "En este libro todo es extraordinario, empezando por su historia. Escrito a principios de los años 60, el autor no pudo conseguir que se editara; creyéndose un escritor frustrado se suicidó en 1969, a los 32 años. Su madre siguió intentando infatigablemente su publicación, lo que no consiguió hasta 1980 (cuando ella tenía 79 años), gracias al apoyo del gran novelista Walker Percy, y tan sólo en una editorial universitaria de Louisiana, cosa en principio muy poco prometedora para una consagración literaria. Y, sin embargo, el libro alcanzó en pocos meses un éxito inmenso, coronado en 1981 con el premio Pulitzer y con la crítica más entusiasta y unánime aparecida en muchos años. Su autor ha sido comparado a Cervantes, Fielding, Swift, Rabelais, Dickens... Resulta imposible resumir la trama picaresca y siempre sorprendente de esta obra, ambientada en Nueva Orleans y sus bajos fondos. Su figura central es uno de los personajes más memorables de la literatura norteamericana: Ignatius Reilly ?una mezcla de Oliver Hardy delirante, Don Quijote adiposo y Tomás de Aquino perverso, reunidos en una persona?, que vive a los 30 años con su estrafalaria madre, ocupado en escribir una extensa y demoledora denuncia contra nuestro siglo, tan carente de «teología y geometría» como de «decencia y buen gusto»; un alegato desquiciado contra una sociedad desquiciada. Por una inesperada necesidad de dinero, se ve «catapultado en la fiebre de la existencia contemporánea», embarcándose en empleos y empresas de lo más disparatado. Los personajes secundarios son tan exóticos (y neuróticos) como los de una película de los Marx Brothers: Darlene la stripteaseuse de la cacatúa; Burma Jones, el quisquilloso portero negro del cabaret Noche de Alegría, regentado por la rapaz Lana Lee, quien completa sus ingresos como modelo de fotos porno; el patrullero Mancuso, el policía más incompetente de la ciudad; Myrna Minkoff, la estudiante contestataria, amiga de Ignatius; Dorian Greene, un líder de la comunidad gay; la desternillante octogenaria Miss Trixie, siempre enfurecida porque no le dan la jubilación... y tantos otros personajes inolvidables.",

    "description": "#1 New York Times bestselling author Renée Ahdieh returns with a sumptuous, sultry and romantic new series set in 19th century New Orleans where vampires hide in plain sight. 'Incredibly ornate [and] lush . . . nail-biting and swoony and satisfying and tense all at the same time' Sabaa Tahir In 1872, New Orleans is a city ruled by the dead. But to seventeen-year-old Celine Rousseau, it's also a safe haven after she's forced to flee her life in Paris. Quickly enraptured by the vibrant city, from its music to its extravagant soirées and even its danger, she soon becomes embroiled in the city's glitzy underworld, and particularly the group known as La Cour des Lions. But when a body is found in their lair, Celine is forced to battle her attraction for the group's enigmatic leader, Sébastien Saint Germain, and suspicions about his guilt, along with her own secrets. As more bodies are discovered, New Orleans becomes gripped by the terror of a serial killer on the loose - one who seems to have Celine in his sights. But when she finally takes matters into her own hands, she finds herself caught in the midst of an age-old feud between the darkest creatures of the night, where the price of forbidden love is her life.",

    "description": "Bestselling author of Room, Emma Donoghue returns with her new masterpiece, Akin, a brilliant tale of love, loss and family. Noah is only days away from his first trip back to Nice since he was a child when a social worker calls looking for a temporary home for Michael, his eleven-year-old great-nephew. Though he has never met the boy, he gets talked into taking him along to France. This odd couple, suffering from jet lag and culture shock, argue about everything from steak haché to screen time, and the trip is looking like a disaster. But as Michael's sharp eye and ease with tech help Noah unearth troubling details about their family’s past, both come to grasp the risks that loved ones take for one another, and find they are more akin than they knew. Written with all the tenderness and psychological intensity that made Room a huge bestseller, Akin is a funny, heart-wrenching tale of an old man and a young boy who unpick their painful stories and embark on writing a new one together.",

    "description": "Patricia Westerford – detta Patty-la-Pianta – comincia a parlare all’età di tre anni. Quando finalmente le parole iniziano a fluire, assomigliano piuttosto a un farfugliare incomprensibile. L’unico che sembra capire il mondo di Patricia, sin da piccola innamorata di qualsiasi cosa avesse dei ramoscelli, è suo padre – “la sua aria e la sua acqua” – che la porta con sé nei viaggi attraverso i boschi e le foreste d’America, a scoprire la misteriosa e stupefacente varietà degli alberi. Cresciuta, dottorata ribelle in botanica, Patty-la-Pianta fa una scoperta sensazionale che potrebbe rappresentare il disvelamento del mistero del mondo, il compimento di una vita spesa a guardare e ascoltare la natura: le piante comunicano fra loro tramite un codice segreto. Ma questo è solo l’inizio di una storia che si dipana come per anelli concentrici: intorno a Patty-la-Pianta si intrecciano infatti i destini di nove indimenticabili personaggi che a poco a poco convergono in California, dove una sequoia gigante rischia di essere abbattuta. Il sussurro del mondo è un’opera immensa, un appassionato atto di resistenza e impegno, un inno d’amore alla letteratura, al potere delle storie, alla grandiosità della natura. Dalla motivazione del Premio Pulitzer 2019 per la Narrativa: “Un romanzo dalla costruzione geniale, rigoglioso e ramificato come gli alberi di cui racconta: la meraviglia della loro interazione evoca quella degli uomini che vi vivono accanto.” Miglior libro del 2018 per The New York Times, The Washington Post, Time, The Oprah Magazine, Newsweek, Chicago Tribune, Kirkus Reviews. Premio Pulitzer 2019, Gran Prix de Littérature Américaine 2018, finalista al Booker Prize 2019, finalista al PEN/Jean Stein Book Award 2019. “Se Richard Powers fosse uno scrittore del diciannovesimo secolo chi sarebbe? Herman Melville e avrebbe scritto Moby Dick.” Margaret Atwood “Un capolavoro, un romanzo straordinario.” Kirkus Reviews “Un romanzo monumentale.” The New York Times Book Review “Il miglior romanzo mai scritto sugli alberi, uno dei romanzi più belli dell’ultimo decennio.” Ann Patchett “Un libro straordinario, stupefacente.” The Guardian",

This bundle includes the following novels: FIFTY SHADES OF GREY: When college student Anastasia Steele goes to interview young entrepreneur Christian Grey, she encounters a man who is beautiful, brilliant, and intimidating. The unworldly Ana realizes she wants this man, and Grey admits he wants her, too—but on his own terms. When the couple embarks on a daring, passionately physical affair, Ana discovers Christian’s secrets and explores her own desires. FIFTY SHADES DARKER: Daunted by Christian’s dark secrets and singular tastes, Ana has broken off their relationship to start a new career. But desire for Christian still dominates her every waking thought. They rekindle their searing sensual affair, and while Christian wrestles with his inner demons, Ana is forced to make the most important decision of her life. FIFTY SHADES FREED: Now, Ana and Christian have it all—love, passion, intimacy, wealth, and a world of possibilities for their future. But Ana knows that loving her Fifty Shades will not be easy, and that being together will pose challenges that neither of them would anticipate. Just when it seems that their strength together will eclipse any obstacle, misfortune, malice, and fate conspire to turn Ana’s deepest fears into reality. This book is intended for mature audiences.",

    "description": "'Epic . . . Rambunctious . . . Highly entertaining' New York Times 'All we do, mija, is love. Love is the answer. Nothing stops it. Not borders. Not death.' In his final days, beloved and ailing patriarch Miguel Angel de La Cruz, affectionately called Big Angel, has summoned his entire clan for one last legendary birthday party. But as the party approaches, his mother, nearly one hundred, dies, transforming the weekend into a farewell doubleheader. Among the guests is Big Angel's half brother, known as Little Angel, who must reckon with the truth that although he shares a father with his siblings, he has not, as a half gringo, shared a life. Across two bittersweet days in their San Diego neighbourhood, the revellers mingle among the palm trees and cacti, celebrating the lives of Big Angel and his mother, and recounting the many inspiring tales that have passed into family lore, the acts both ordinary and heroic that brought these citizens to a fraught and sublime country and allowed them to flourish in the land they have come to call home. Timely, exuberant and moving, The House of Broken Angels, which was shortlisted for the National Book Critics Circle Award, is Luis Alberto Urrea's long-overdue UK debut.",

    "description": "Life is a lucrative business, as long as you play by the rules. \"[Joanne] Ramos's debut novel couldn't be more relevant or timely.\" —O: The Oprah Magazine (25 Books We Can't Wait to Read in 2019) Nestled in New York's Hudson Valley is a luxury retreat boasting every amenity: organic meals, personal fitness trainers, daily massages—and all of it for free. In fact, you're paid big money to stay here—more than you've ever dreamed of. The catch? For nine months, you cannot leave the grounds, your movements are monitored, and you are cut off from your former life while you dedicate yourself to the task of producing the perfect baby. For someone else. Jane, an immigrant from the Philippines, is in desperate search of a better future when she commits to being a \"Host\" at Golden Oaks—or the Farm, as residents call it. But now pregnant, fragile, consumed with worry for her family, Jane is determined to reconnect with her life outside. Yet she cannot leave the Farm or she will lose the life-changing fee she'll receive on the delivery of her child. Gripping, provocative, heartbreaking, The Farm pushes to the extremes our thinking on motherhood, money, and merit and raises crucial questions about the trade-offs women will make to fortify their futures and the futures of those they love. Advance praise for The Farm \"This topical, provocative debut anatomizes class, race and the American dream.\" —The Guardian, \"What You’ll Be Reading This Year\" \"Wow, Joanne Ramos has written the page-turner about immigrants chasing what's left of the American dream. . . . Truly unforgettable.\" —Gary Shteyngart, New York Times bestselling author of Super Sad True Love Story and Lake Success \"A highly original and provocative story about the impossible choices in so many women's lives. These characters will stay with me for a long time.\" —Karen Thompson Walker, New York Times bestselling author of The Age of Miracles and The Dreamers \"Ramos has written a firecracker of a novel, at once caustic and tender, page-turning and thought-provoking. This is a fierce indictment of the vampiric nature of modern capitalism, which never loses sight of the very human stories at its center. . . . Highly recommended.\" —Madeline Miller, #1 New York Times bestselling author of Circe",

    "description": "A striking and surprising debut novel from an exhilarating new voice, Such a Fun Age is a page-turning and big-hearted story about race and privilege, set around a young black babysitter, her well-intentioned employer, and a surprising connection that threatens to undo them both. Alix Chamberlain is a woman who gets what she wants and has made a living showing other women how to do the same. A mother to two small girls, she started out as a blogger and has quickly built herself into a confidence-driven brand. So she is shocked when her babysitter, Emira Tucker, is confronted while watching the Chamberlains' toddler one night. Seeing a young black woman out late with a white child, a security guard at their local high-end supermarket accuses Emira of kidnapping two-year-old Briar. A small crowd gathers, a bystander films everything, and Emira is furious and humiliated. Alix resolves to make it right. But Emira herself is aimless, broke, and wary of Alix's desire to help. At twenty-five, she is about to lose her health insurance and has no idea what to do with her life. When the video of Emira unearths someone from Alix's past, both women find themselves on a crash course that will upend everything they think they know about themselves, and each other. With empathy and piercing social commentary, Such a Fun Age explores the stickiness of transactional relationships, what it means to make someone \"family,\" the complicated reality of being a grown up, and the consequences of doing the right thing for the wrong reason.",

    "description": "The sky above the port was the colour of television, tuned to a dead channel. William Gibson revolutionised science fiction in his 1984 debut Neuromancer. The writer who gave us the matrix and coined the term 'cyberspace' produced a first novel that won the Hugo, Nebula and Philip K. Dick Awards, and lit the fuse on the Cyberpunk movement. More than three decades later, Gibson's text is as stylish as ever, his noir narrative still glitters like chrome in the shadows and his depictions of the rise and abuse of corporate power look more prescient every day. Part thriller, part warning, Neuromancer is a timeless classic of modern SF and one of the 20th century's most potent and compelling visions of the future.",
