     "Isaiah Berlin"
    ],
    "publishedDate": "1982",
    "description": "This remarkable collection contains Isaiah Berlin's appreciations of seventeen people of unusual distinction in the intellectual or political world, sometimes both. The names of many of them are familiar: Winston Churchill, Franklin D. Roosevelt, Chaim Weizmann, Albert Einstein, and others. With the exception of Roosevelt, he met them all and knew many of them well. For this expanded edition, four new portraits have been added, including those of Virginia Woolf and Edmund Wilson. This volume also contains a vivid and moving account of Berlin's meetings in Russia with Boris Pasternak and Anna Akhmatova in 1945 and 1956. Perhaps the most fascinating of these \"personal impressions\" is found in the epilogue, where Berlin describes the three strands in his own personality: Russian, English, and Jewish.",

    "authors": [
     "Theresa Papenfus"
    ],
    "publishedDate": "2010",
    "description": "This biography reads like a novel: exciting, moving and humorous. It is the story of an inspiring politician who wrote verses on the back of cigarette boxes, a minister with the finesse of a battering ram, a peacemaker, and ambassador who never had to take \"No\" for an answer, and a man who was happiest when sitting next to a campfire in the bush. And it is far more. Theresa Papenfus depicts Botha against the broader political and social background of his time. This work is also an account of a tempestuous period in South African history. New facts are revealed on events such as the aviation disaster in which samora Machel was killed. The research covers a formidable range of sources, including personal interviews and correspondence with authoritative and prominent South African and international figures. And then there are Pik Botha's verses, personal documents and the numerous interviews he granted. Valuable. Thorough. Absorbing. ' Jeanette Ferreira, literary critic, editor and writer....\" An authoritative source of information ... that could never be ignored ... direct, with no mincing of words or empty praise ... a work that attests to intensive research and broad knowledge, sensitive but without sentimentality or obfuscation.' Marinus Wiechers, Professor Emeritus of Constitutional , International and Indigenous Law and former principal, Unisa. ...' \"History owes her a favor for writing this book. I enjoyed it immensely.' Peter Sullivan, former editor of The Star and Group Editor-in-Chief, Independent Newspapers, South Africa.REVIEWS \"Even in the broader literature, no book exists that covers these events together in one volume and certainly not with anything approaching the depth and first-hand insight that Papenfus marshals. Pik Botha and his times is precisely the sort of book any writer on Southern African political history will want to have to hand for reference purposes if nothing else.\" -- Jamie Miler, University of Cambridge\"... a page-turner ... certainly one of the most fascinating biographies written by a South African writer concerning a South African politician and can be highly recommended.\" -The Star, Pretoria News review by Cyrus Smith. \"Anyone who has an interest in the history of the National Party and apartheid and in South African history from the second half of the previous century to the early years of the present one, and who has a liking for biographies, should get to grips with this extensive work. This is undoubtedly an authoritative source of information, worthy of a place of honour among the ranks of the good biographies; it is also a valuable addition to South African historiography.\" -- Koers",

    "description": "In this revelatory memoir, doctor Cynthia Li shares the truth other doctors don't always understand and often won't share if they do--that chronic illness is complicated, and that treatment is not just a matter of test results and prescriptions but requires a more comprehensive approach. By sharing her own struggle with a disabling autoimmune crisis, which forced her to question her own conventional medical training and embrace the integrative principles of functional medicine, Li reveals the insider knowledge sufferers need to truly begin healing--mind, body, and spirit.",

    "publishedDate": "2008-01",
    "description": "The past thirty years have witnessed a rapid growth in the number and variety of courses and programs that study life writing from literary, philosophical, psychological, and cultural perspectives. The field has evolved from the traditional approach that biographies and autobiographies were always about prominent people--historically significant persons, the nobility, celebrities, writers--to the conception of life writing as a genre of interrogation and revelation. The texts now studied include memoirs, testimonios, diaries, oral histories, genealogies, and group biographies and extend to resources in the visual and plastic arts, in films and videos, and on the Internet. Today the tensions between canonical and emergent life writing texts, between the famous and the formerly unrepresented, are making the study of biography and autobiography a far more nuanced and multifarious activity. This volume in the MLA series Options for Teaching builds on and complements earlier work on pedagogical issues in life writing studies. Over forty contributors from a broad range of educational institutions describe courses for every level of postsecondary instruction. Some writers draw heavily on literary and cultural theory; others share their assignments and weekly syllabi. Many essays grapple with texts that represent disability, illness, abuse, and depression; ethnic, sexual and racial discrimination; crises and catastrophes; witnessing and testimonials; human rights violations; and genocide. The classes described are taught in humanities, cultural studies, social science, and language departments and are located in, among other countries, the United States, Great Britain, Canada, Australia, Germany, Eritrea, and South Africa.",

    "publisher": "HarperPerennial",
    "publishedDate": "2005",
    "description": "SIDETRACKS is a sister book toFOOTSTEPSconjured up from decades of 'wanderings from the straight and narrow' of his major biographies like SHELLEY and COLERIDGE. The collection is held together by a subtle autobiographical thread: 'to be sidetracked is, after all, to be led astray by a path or an idea, a scent or a tune, and maybe lost forever.' The centerpiece of book concerns Mary Woolstonecraft, the great feminist crusader and philosopher, and her relationship with William Godwin. Their story and travails are inspiring and poignant, all told in riveting and beautiful prose style. SIDETRACKS winds through an extraordinary and eclectic assortment of Romantic and Gothic writers and personalities: some French, some English, some Dutch, some American, some major, some minor, but all made hypnotically alive and memorable through Holmes's transforming touch. We meet Chatterton and Gautier, Pierrot and Voltaire, Mary Wollstonecraft and Godwin, Scott Fitzgerald and Zelda, James Boswell and Zelide, MR James and some very unpleasant gothic apparitions. With each of these twenty pieces Holmes shows how fluid, playful and unconstrained the many voices of biography can be. The book includes two documentary radio-plays, many different kinds of character sketch and travelogue, true love stories and true ghost stories, and one piece, 'Dr Johnson's First Cat' which may or may not be a piece of true biographical fiction. SIDETRACKS is a renewed examination of the strange and sometimes shadowy pathways of biography that have always fascinated Holmes.",

As the close colleague of legendary musicians such as Horowitz, Rubinstein, Gould, Serkin, and many others, Franz Mohr has attended to their instruments, making delicate adjustments that affect tone, balance, and other characteristics of sound. It is Mohr who enables virtuosos to fully realize their own individual interpretative styles and concepts of tonal color. Besides recounting his experiences as master piano technician, Franz Mohr helps us to understand the quest for perfection and sensitivity expressed in the lives of a select group of individuals, in the crafting of a piano, and in all of life. He shares his personal story and how his experiences have brought a deeper melody to his work. The life story of Franz Mohr is a collection of stories that reveal his love for music, the piano, the people who play it, and a God who has given him the talent to be a part of the world he loves.",

This is a book based upon a formidably wide-ranging bibliography together with his own, by no means insignificant, contributions to the field...[the]...reader will be left in no doubt as to the central importance of biographical research and of its legitimate position within the social sciences\" - David Morgan, Emeritus Professor of Sociology, Manchester University (former President, British Sociological Association), Auto/Biography, a BSA Study Group journal, 2002. \"Brian Roberts' book is a highly accessible introduction to biographical method...The author deftly and confidently addresses the available work in a variety of disciplines ranging from education through oral history, feminism to memory... I warmly recommend this book to any historian interested in biography and what its study can tell them about what they do'. - Alun Munslow, Professor of History, Staffordshire University (Editor, Rethinking History), Rethinking History, 7:3, pp. 451-5, October, 2003 * What is biographical research? * Why has it attracted so much interest? * How can biographical research be carried out? Biographical Research reflects a rapid expansion of interest in the study of lives taking place within the social sciences. Life story, oral history, narrative, autobiography, biography and other approaches are being used more and more to explore how individuals interpret experiences and social relationships. This book examines the methodological and theoretical developments associated with research on lives in sociology, oral history, ethnography, biography, and narrative analysis. The author includes numerous examples of biographical research from his own work and other studies, and addresses important areas such as the collection and interpretation of materials, uses of biographical research, oral and written accounts, the interview relationship, the construction of the story, memory, audience, and the researcher's own biography. In conclusion it draws out common themes and emerging concerns. Biographical Research is a comprehensive guide to major issues in the study of lives for students and researchers in the social sciences and related fields.",

    "description": "The architect-engineer Wells Wintemute Coates (1895-1958) numbers amongst the most significant figures in the history of 20th-century British architecture. Through projects such as the Lawn Road Flats of 1934; the Sunspan Houses of the mid-1930s; Embassy Court Flats 1936; Palace Gate Flats, 1939 and the Telekinema for the Festival of Britain, 1951, he is recognised as one of those who brought about the introduction and development of architectural modernism in the UK. His reputation in this respect has increased in the past decade: Coates's work for Isokon was featured in the 1999 'Modern Britain' exhibition at the Design Museum, while, more recently, the restoration of Lawn Road and Embassy Court has brought his work to the attention of a new audience. Despite this reputation and recognition, there is little published work on Wells Coates and only the biography-memoir (1999) by his daughter Laura Cohn remains in print. This is a valuable study but is ultimately personal rather than architectural in its analysis. The (out of print) monograph by Cantacuzino (1978), whilst it provides scholars with a solid and informative account of Coates' life, and a near-complete Catalogue Raisonée, is now rather dated in its approach. It is, therefore, an appropriate moment for a new study of this significant figure to be published. Its primary concern will be to re-introduce Coates to a modern audience, presenting a thorough account of his oeuvre and the context in which it was created. It will show how Coates, as a designer of products, interiors and buildings, developed a new formal and spatial language of design which worked to shape and influence the path British modernism would take both during the 1930s and after the war.",

No sé bien dónde encuadrar estos trabajos: aunque están muy documentados, no son ni biografías académicas ni artículos periodísticos, sino unos textos muy apasionados, muy personales. Son historias de mujeres singulares a las que intenté entender. Las hay generosas y las hay malvadas, cobardes o valientes, turbulentas o tímidas; todas son, eso sí, muy originales y algunas resultan pasmosas por lo extraordinario de sus peripecias. Pero creo que, por muy raras que parezcan, siempre podemos reconocernos en ellas. Y es que cada uno de nosotros encierra dentro de si todas las vidas\". Rosa Montero",

Ann Wroe, the current obituaries editor, says she likes to \"get the essence\" right away. Discovering Arthur Miller had been a carpenter made her realise how beautifully crafted his plays were, and after Hunter Thompson committed suicide his obituary began \"There were always way too many guns around at Hunter S. Thompson's farm.\" The Economist's obituary column was introduced in 1995 and the selection of over 200 obituaries for this book ranges far and wide to include Jean Bedel Bokassa and Pope John Paul II, Jean Baudrillard and Syd Barrett, Pamela Harriman and Harry Oppenheimer, Estee Lauder and Ingmar Bergman, Bip (the mime artist, Marcel Marceau) and Alex the African Grey (science's best-known parrot).",

Yogi Berra loved his family, his neighborhood, his friends, and, most of all, baseball. He was crazy for it, ever since he was a young kid playing with friends in an abandoned dump. But baseball didn't love him back--at least not at first. Yogi was different. He didn't have the right look. When he finally made it to the major leagues, Yogi faced pranks and harassment from players, sportswriters, and fans. Their words hurt, but they made Yogi determined to show all that he could do. Author Barb Rosenstock's dynamic text and illustrator Terry Widener's powerful artwork reveal the talents, loves, and inspirational words of this celebrated New York Yankee and American icon, who earned a World Series ring for each finger and made baseball love him back.",

It was 1966 and Eddie had just been accepted into Yale Law School--his ticket out of the Army and Vietnam and into a life of secure prosperity. It took only one day, one decision to change the course of his life. What follows is a sometimes harrowing, often hilarious, and always illuminating ten-year journey through the social, political, and spiritual turmoil of the era. For anyone wondering how it was back then--or how to get through right now--Living on the Fringe provides a look at how one person waded into the turbulent waters of his time and came out whole, dry, and ready to face the future. And with a new name to match the person he had become. \"Abraham Entin has written a really magnificent book...a delightful read from cover to cover. So buy it and read it--you won't be disappointed.\" --Ken Cloke, author, founder and director of Center for Dispute Resolution \"Abraham Entin has written an outrageous, hugely entertaining memoir...about what it's like to go up against the man and come out smiling--and still fighting--on the other side.\" --Saul Rubinek, actor, writer, producer, and director in theater, film, and television",

Entries fall into three main categories: poet entries, which provide biographical and cultural contexts for the author's career; entries on individual works, which offer closer explication of the most resonant poems in the 20th-century canon; and topical entries, which offer analyses of a given period of literary production, school, thematically constructed category, or other verse tradition that historically has been in dialogue with the poetry of the United States.",

Love, politics, murder, wars, and the fracturing of ties, personal and ethnic. O'Clery is a gifted writer.' Luke Harding, bestselling author of Collusion The Soviet Union, 1962. Gifted shoemaker Stanislav Suvorov is imprisoned for five years. His crime? Selling his car for a profit. On his release, social shame drives him and his family into voluntary exile in Siberia, 5,000 kilometres from home. In a climate that's unfriendly both geographically and politically, it's their chance to start again. The Shoemaker and His Daughter is an epic story spanning the Second World War to the fall of the Soviet Union, taking in eighty years of Soviet and Russian history, from Stalin to Putin. Following the footsteps of a remarkable family Conor O'Clery knows well - he is married to the shoemaker's daughter - it's both a compelling insight into life in a secretive world at a siesmic moment in time and a powerful tale of ordinary lives shaped by extraordinary times.",

    "description": "During his extraordinary broadcasting career of over sixty years Alistair Cooke encountered many legendary figures, in the varied worlds of journalism, politics, public life, sport and entertainment. This is his highly personal account of just six of those remarkable men that he knew and admired. Here are candid portraits of the lovable yet unreliable Charlie Chaplin, who, when asked to be Cooke's best man, mysteriously vanished on the wedding day; the charming yet childlike `golden boy' Edward VIII; Cooke's mentor, the flawed contrarian and satirist H. L. Mencken; Humphrey Bogart, revealing the complex and private man behind the tough guy-image; the larger-than-life liberal politician Adlai Stevenson; and the heroic social reformer Bertrand Russell. Each superbly realized description is a masterpiece of observation, warmth and humour, recalling a golden age of `great men'.",

    "description": "Formed as a New York City hardcore band in 1981, Beastie Boys struck an unlikely path to global hip hop superstardom. Here is their story, told for the first time in the words of the band. Adam \"AD-ROCK\" Horovitz and Michael \"Mike D\" Diamond offer revealing and very funny accounts of their transition from teenage punks to budding rappers; their early collaboration with Russell Simmons and Rick Rubin; the almost impossible-to-fathom overnight success of their debut studio album Licensed to Ill; that album's messy fallout; their break with Def Jam, move to Los Angeles, and rebirth as musicians and social activists, with the genre-defying masterpiece Paul's Boutique. For more than twenty years, this band has had a wide-ranging and lasting influence on popular culture. With a style as distinctive and eclectic as a Beastie Boys album, Beastie Boys Book upends the typical music memoir. Alongside the band narrative you will find rare photos, original illustrations, a cookbook by chef Roy Choi, a graphic novel, a map of Beastie Boys' New York, mixtape playlists, pieces by guest contributors, and many more surprises.",

What on earth did Simone de Beauvoir see in Jean-Paul Sartre? How to Sound Cultured offers a wry and yet profoundly useful look inside the mirrored palaces of high culture. Covering such inscrutable characters as Heidegger, Montaigne, Kahlo and Levi-Strauss (apparently not just a designer of jeans), inscrutable polymaths Thomas W. Hodgkinson and Hubert van den Bergh - the author of the acclaimed How to Sound Clever - have done the hard work of sorting the cultural wheat from the chaff. Read this book and you'll never again mistake Rimbaud for Rambo or Georg Lukacs for George Lucas, you'll know precisely when to drop Foucault's name into a conversation and how to pronounce 'Borgesian', and you'll learn many more essential pointers for the intellectual life.",
