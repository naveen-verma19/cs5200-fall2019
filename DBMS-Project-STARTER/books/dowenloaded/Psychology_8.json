    "description": "Zur Neuauflage: Die außerordentlich dynamische Entwicklung der Sozialpsychologie in den letzten Jahren hat es notwendig gemacht, dieses Lehrbuch gründlich zu überarbeiten und teilweise völlig neu zu gestalten. Diese neueren Entwicklungen betreffen v.a. die folgenden Bereiche: Soziale Kognition als Konzeptualisierung sozialpsychologischer Themen in Modellvorstellungen der Informationsverarbeitung; die Entwicklungen der Evolutionären Psychologie; das Thema der Emotionen und eine stärkere Beachtung der Zwei-Prozess-Modelle. Die vorliegende dritte Auflage dieses Lehrbuches ist jedoch nicht allein durch neue Entwicklungen der Sozialpsychologie veranlasst, sondern auch durch den Umstand, dass die Autoren im Rahmen einer Wirtschafts- und Sozialwissenschaftlichen Fakultät angesiedelt sind und insofern die Verbindungslinien zwischen Sozialpsychologie und Wirtschaftspsychologie besonders betonen.",

Elizabeth Graue and Daniel Walsh discuss the research process, dealing succinctly with generic issues but emphasizing where work with children presents its own particular challenges. Part One looks across the research enterprise, conceptualizing it as an holistic activity.

    "description": "We all have opinions about the television shows we watch, but television criticism is about much more than simply evaluating the merits of a particular show and deeming it ‘good’ or ‘bad.’ Rather, criticism uses the close examination of a television program to explore that program’s cultural significance, creative strategies, and its place in a broader social context. How to Watch Television brings together forty original essays from today’s leading scholars on television culture, writing about the programs they care (and think) the most about. Each essay focuses on a particular television show, demonstrating one way to read the program and, through it, our media culture. The essays model how to practice media criticism in accessible language, providing critical insights through analysis—suggesting a way of looking at TV that students and interested viewers might emulate. The contributors discuss a wide range of television programs past and present, covering many formats and genres, spanning fiction and non-fiction, broadcast and cable, providing a broad representation of the programs that are likely to be covered in a media studies course. While the book primarily focuses on American television, important programs with international origins and transnational circulation are also covered. Addressing television series from the medium’s earliest days to contemporary online transformations of television, How to Watch Television is designed to engender classroom discussion among television critics of all backgrounds.

    "description": "The authenticity of memories of childhood sexual abuse has become one of the major social controversies of the 1990's. As persons who report histories of abuse have sought remedies in civil and criminal proceedings in the courts, the accuracy of their memories--particularly when they have been recalled after a period of time--has been subject to intense scrutiny. This volume brings together many of the leading participants in the debate to provide a comprehensive picture of the psychological, physiological, and legal aspects of trauma. Beginning by defining the opposing positions in the debate, the contributors then offer a variety of perspectives on the nature of memory, including reviews of some of the most exciting recent developments in this fast-growing area of investigation. Next, consideration is given to the impact of trauma on memory, both in adults and in children. With this framework in place, the authors turn to an examination of the variety of treatment approaches available to victims of trauma, who are trying to cope with the painful consequences of those events. The book argues against a unidimensional approach to trauma, calling instead for a multidisciplinary synthesis that includes developmental, neurobiological, cognitive, and psychodynamic perspectives. Chapters address the legal dilemmas for patients, mental health professionals and society as a whole that have arisen from the trauma and memory controversy. Most importantly, the editors shift the focus of their discussion from the laboratory to the courtroom and from the research journal to the psychotherapist's office, looking at the issues from every relevant angle. This is the only book in the field to treat the trauma and memory controversy comprehensively, from basic research on memory processes through clinical approaches to legal and policy issues. Trauma and Memory is a valuable tool for clinicians treating patients with traumatic memories. It is also intended for psychologists, physicians, social workers and lawyers who need a comprehensive reference on trauma and sexual abuse during childhood.",

    "description": "Studienarbeit aus dem Jahr 2002 im Fachbereich Psychologie - Klinische u. Gesundheitspsychologie, Psychopathologie, Note: sehr gut, Universität Wien (Psychologisches Institut), Sprache: Deutsch, Abstract: „Simulation für bare Münze zu nehmen bedeutet, dass wir Programme als soziale Akteure behandeln, mit denen wir „ins Geschäft“ kommen können, sofern sie funktionieren. So gesehen verdient die Frage, ob Menschen oder Maschinen die besseren Psychotherapeuten sind, eher empirische Untersuchungen als philosophische Spekulationen.“ (Simulation als bare Münze, S. 164) Sherry Turkle beschreibt in diesem Kapitel die Entwicklung des Bezugs zwischen Mensch und Computer anhand von Psychotherapeutenprogramme. Generell sieht sie den Menschen als soziales Wesen, das mit anderen kommunizieren will. Aus Kommentaren von Leuten, die DEPRESSION 2.0 benutzt haben (Es handelt sich hierbei um ein Computerprogramm, das auf die Behandlung von Depression spezialisiert ist und sich selbst als Psychotherapeut vorstellt), geht hervor, dass sie es zwar „plump“ finden, aber seine Hilfe größtenteils gern in Anspruch nehmen, ohne sich darüber den Kopf zu zerbrechen. Personen können diesem Programm alles Mögliche anvertrauen und diese Erfahrung dann mit der Bemerkung abtuen: „Es ist ja nur ein Programm.“ Ende der siebziger Jahre hörte man oft die Bemerkung: „Es behagt mir nicht, mich mit einer Maschine zu unterhalten, als wäre sie eine Person.“ Heute dagegen sagen viele Leute eher so etwas wie: „Psychotherapie ist das, was der Psychotherapeut tut.“ Oder: „Ich bezweifle, dass die heutigen Maschinen den Anforderungen gewachsen sind, aber höchstwahrscheinlich sind bessere in der Entwicklung. Zeigen Sie mir das Programm, das sie haben. Vielleicht wird es mich überzeugen.“",

    "description": "This book is not an intellectual history or popular summary of recent work on consciousness in humans. Bernard Baars (1988), Edelman and Tononi (2000), and many others, have written such, and done it well indeed. This book, rather, brings the powerful analytic machinery of communication theory to bear on the Global Neuronal Workspace (GNW) model of consciousness which Baars introduced, and does so in a formal mathematical manner. It is not the first such attempt. The philospher Fred Dretske (1981), indep- dent of Baars, long ago outlined how information theory might illuminate the understanding of mind. Adapting his approach on the necessary conditions for mental process, we apply a previously-developed information theory analysis of interacting cognitive biological and social modules to Baars' GNW, which has become the principal candidate for a 'standard model' of consciousness. Invoking an obvious canonical homology with statistical physics, the method, when iterated in the spirit of the Hierarchical Linear Model of regression theory, generates a fluctuating dynamic threshold for consciousness which is similar to a tunable phase transition in a physical system. The phenomenon is, however, constrained to a manifold/atlas structure analogous to a retina; an adaptable Rate Distortion manifold, whose 'topology', in a large sense, reflects the hierarchy of embedding constraints acting on consciousness. This view greatly extends what Baars has characterized as 'contexts.",

    "description": "How was it possible for opponents of slavery to be so vocal in opposing the practice, when they were so accepting of the economic exploitation of workers in western factories – many of which were owned by prominent abolitionists? David Brion Davis's The Problem of Slavery in the Age of Revolution, 1770-1823, uses the critical thinking skill of analysis to break down the various arguments that were used to condemn one set of controversial practices, and examine those that were used to defend another. His study allows us to see clear differences in reasoning and to test the assumptions made by each argument in turn. The result is an eye-opening explanation that makes it clear exactly how contemporaries resolved this apparent dichotomy – one that allows us to judge whether the opponents of slavery were clear-eyed idealists, or simply deployers of arguments that pandered to their own base economic interests.",

    "description": "Truly global in scope and with contributions from leading researchers around the world, The Handbook of Cannabis is the definitive resource on this fascinating drug. Combining scientific perspectives and clinical applications, it covers a vast array of topics, from why over the centuries cannabis has been used as a medicine, through the regulations facing those wishing to self-administer cannabis or provide cannabis-based medicines, to the chemical structure of its many constituents and the rapidly growing group of synthetic cannabinoids that are currently being used for 'legal highs'. With each chapter written by a group of one or more internationally recognised subject experts, it provides academics and researchers with authoritative scientific material on the main pharmacological actions and their effects, as well as their pharmacokinetics, metabolism, and forensic detection. In addition it also examines the complex morphology, cultivation, harvesting, and processing of cannabis and the ways in which the plant's chemical composition can be controlled. As well as offering a raft of scientific information there is extensive coverage of cannabinoid-based medicines. Helping readers to identify and evaluate their benefits, chapters explore pharmacological actions and the effects that seem to underlie approved therapeutic uses, how they are currently used to treat certain disorders, and the ever-growing number of wide-ranging potential clinical applications. There is also coverage of both the legal and illegal sources of cannabis, including 'coffee shops' and 'cannabis dispensaries'. The complex issue of 'recreational cannabis' is also tackled. The sought-after and adverse psychological and non-psychological effects are described and discussions are included on how some adverse effects can be lessened by at least one constituent of cannabis, and that it might be possible to reduce the harm that cannabis does to some by changing current regulatory policies. The Handbook of Cannabis is a one-stop reference; essential reading for all clinicians, pharmacologists, psychologists, and psychiatrists interested in this drug, as well as those working in the field of public health.",

What treatments are available for the condition this patient has? What is the evidence for the effectiveness of each of these treatments? Is there any value in combinations of treatment? And, can I be sure that the evidence and recommendations are free from bias? This handy pocket reference summarises the key elements of the Cambridge Textbook of Effective Treatments in Psychiatry. The text has been revised to provide the most up-to-date evidence for treatment decisions, with an accompanying summary table for each chapter to reinforce the recommendations. It is an essential guide for mental health professionals of all disciplines as well as medical students and trainees.",

    "description": "During the last 15 years, human sociobiology has metamorphosed into evolutionary psychology. It is concerned with the social problems and stresses hominid and primate ancestors encountered, the psychological mechanisms natural selection shaped to deal with these stresses, and the way those ancient mechanisms work now. Evolutionary psychologists are making great progress in expanding the understanding of human nature, however, this knowledge has had little impact on policymakers and legislators. Supreme Court justices and managers seldom consult evolutionary psychologists to help with their deliberations. When faced with private decisions few individuals ask themselves how a Darwinian perspective might help them. This volume's aim is to start the process of using theory and findings of evolutionary psychology to help make the world a better place to live. This book takes evolutionary psychology explicitly into applied areas in a way no other book has. It includes a reasonable scope of applications from pornography to psychopaths and from morality to sex differences in the workplace. An applications section provides concrete ideas for dealing with social and policy issues, including chapters on women in the workplace, rape, and child support. Providing good coverage of basic issues and theory of the field, this book gives lay people and law/policymakers appropriate background to fully understand the applications chapters. Part II provides information on basic psychological mechanisms for group living--including chapters on emotions, reciprocity and legal reasoning, and self deception--that impact on how well public policy and law function. The material in the first two sections provide an intellectual basis for the chapters in the third part of the book which deals with the application of evolutionary psychology to a variety of substantive areas related to public policy and personal decisions. A political scientist concludes the book with a commentary on evolutionary psychology and public policy. The book is designed to serve as a stand-alone text in evolutionary psychology and public policy that can be used in a variety of disciplines, such as psychology, social work, law and psychology, and public policy.",

    "description": "The past twenty years have witnessed a surge in behavioral studies of law and law-related issues. These studies have challenged the application of the rational-choice model to legal analysis and introduced a more accurate and empirically grounded model of human behavior. This integration of economics, psychology, and law is breaking exciting new ground in legal theory and the social sciences, shedding a new light on age-old legal questions as well as cutting edge policy issues. The Oxford Handbook of Behavioral Economics and Law brings together leading scholars of law, psychology, and economics to provide an up-to-date and comprehensive analysis of this field of research, including its strengths and limitations as well as a forecast of its future development. Its 29 chapters organized in four parts. The first part provides a general overview of behavioral economics. The second part comprises four chapters introducing and criticizing the contribution of behavioral economics to legal theory. The third part discusses specific behavioral phenomena, their ramifications for legal policymaking, and their reflection in extant law. Finally, the fourth part analyzes the contribution of behavioral economics to fifteen legal spheres ranging from core doctrinal areas such as contracts, torts and property to areas such as taxation and antitrust policy.",

    "description": "If journalism is the first draft of history, then independent journalists are surely its most daring composers. Along such celebrated and high-profile figures as Christiane Amanpour and Wolf Blitzer, there exists a stratum of journalistsself-employed, working under dire conditions, and with minimal resourceswho often place themselves at ground zero of world events. In this gripping account, Anthony Collings takes us into the world of independent journalists, and the daily challenges they face confronting dictators, hostile military, and narcoterrorists. Unfettered by any ties to those in positions of power, these guerrilla journalists are often the first on a storywhether reporting on corruption in Mexico, organized crime in Russia, or sexual scandal in the Middle Eastand accordingly face the brunt of their subject's wrath. Collings, who has himself been held captive while on assignment, here focuses less on those nations in which the press is either largely free (such as the U.S. or Western European democracies) or aggressively restricted (as in China), and more on those \"battleground countries\" where the eventual outcome of the struggle between state and fourth estate remains unclear. Relying on interviews, professional contacts, and his own experiences, Collings explores the dilemmas and strategies of journalists who persevere in the face of war, repressive governments, and criminal aggression, with particular emphasis on the role of the Internet. At a time when journalism is increasingly a profession under siege, Words of Fire forces into the spotlight a more positive side of the profession, those who pursue journalism not for profit or fame but as a personal crusade.",

    "description": "Positive psychology is the scientific study of what goes right in life, from birth to death and at all stops in between. It is a newly-christened approach within psychology that takes seriously the examination of that which makes life most worth living. Everyone's life has peaks and valleys, and positive psychology does not deny the valleys. Its signature premise is more nuanced, but nonetheless important: what is good about life is as genuine as what is bad and, therefore, deserves equal attention from psychologists. Positive psychology as an explicit perspective has existed only since 1998, but enough relevant theory and research now exist to fill a textbook suitable for a semester-long college course. A Primer in Positive Psychology is thoroughly grounded in scientific research and covers major topics of concern to the field: positive experiences such as pleasure and flow; positive traits such as character strengths, values, and talents; and the social institutions that enable these subjects as well as what recent research might contribute to this knowledge. Every chapter contains exercises that illustrate positive psychology, a glossary, suggestions of articles and books for further reading, and lists of films, websites, and popular songs that embody chapter themes. A comprehensive overview of positive psychology by one of the acknowledged leaders in the field, this textbook provides students with a thorough introduction to an important area of psychology.",

    "description": "The brain contains many distinct functional and anatomical regions. Despite these differences, brain tissues are sufficiently uniform in the fact that they can engage in various types of processing. How can functionally different kinds of processes, such as verbal memory and reasoning, visual and auditory memory, and mental imagery, all be supported by the relatively uniform electrochemical activity of a brain's neurons? How are they appropriately segregated and integrated as needed? In Aging, Representation, and Thought, Matthew J. Sharps provides an empirically based, functional answer to what is, from the standpoint of modern cognitive psychology, a critical theoretical issue.Sharps argues that the crucial factor is the degree to which information is subjected to processing that is more gestalt or feature-intensive in nature. Sharps shows that purely gestalt processing deals with information in large \"chunks,\" providing for relatively little incisive analysis. Purely feature-intensive processing, on the other hand, tends to ignore the overall nature and context of information in favor of comparatively minute analyses. It provides for relatively comprehensive analysis, but also for slow, cumbersome processing. Neither process, however, works in isolation, and Sharps demonstrates how information processing occurs on a continuum between the two extremes.Sharps' theoretical perspective is amply borne out by the results of specific experiments in all of the cognitive realms he addresses. He provides relatively comprehensive explanations for a variety of phenomena including the diminution of specific cognitive processes with age, and errors in eyewitness memory, reasoning, and decision-making at all levels of human activity. Aging, Representation, and Thought will be of interest to psychologists, students of adult development and aging, and management specialists.",

    "publisher": "Simon and Schuster",
    "publishedDate": "2010-11-01",
    "description": "“I didn’t decide to become anorexic. It snuck up on me disguised as a healthy diet, a professional attitude. Being as thin as possible was a way to make the job of being an actress easier . . .” Portia de Rossi weighed only 82 pounds when she collapsed on the set of the Hollywood film in which she was playing her first leading role. This should have been the culmination of all her years of hard work—first as a child model in Australia, then as a cast member of one of the hottest shows on American television. On the outside she was thin and blond, glamorous and successful. On the inside, she was literally dying. In this searing, unflinchingly honest book, Portia de Rossi captures the complex emotional truth of what it is like when food, weight, and body image take priority over every other human impulse or action. She recounts the elaborate rituals around eating that came to dominate hours of every day, from keeping her daily calorie intake below 300 to eating precisely measured amounts of food out of specific bowls and only with certain utensils. When this wasn’t enough, she resorted to purging and compulsive physical exercise, driving her body and spirit to the breaking point. Even as she rose to fame as a cast member of the hit television shows Ally McBeal and Arrested Development, Portia alternately starved herself and binged, all the while terrified that the truth of her sexuality would be exposed in the tabloids. She reveals the heartache and fear that accompany a life lived in the closet, a sense of isolation that was only magnified by her unrelenting desire to be ever thinner. With the storytelling skills of a great novelist and the eye for detail of a poet, Portia makes transparent as never before the behaviors and emotions of someone living with an eating disorder. From her lowest point, Portia began the painful climb back to a life of health and honesty, falling in love with and eventually marrying Ellen DeGeneres, and emerging as an outspoken and articulate advocate for gay rights and women’s health issues. In this remarkable and beautifully written work, Portia shines a bright light on a dark subject. A crucial book for all those who might sometimes feel at war with themselves or their bodies, Unbearable Lightness is a story that inspires hope and nourishes the spirit.",

Authored by leading international experts, each chapter represents a personal and historical narrative of the theory’s development including the inspirations, critical junctures, and problem-solving efforts that effected theoretical choices and determined the theory’s impact and its evolution. Unique to this handbook, these narratives provide a rich background for understanding how theories are created, nurtured, and shaped over time, and examining their unique contribution to the field as a whole. To examine its societal impact, each theory is evaluated in terms of its applicability to better understanding and solving critical social issues and problems. The Handbook of Theories of Social Psychology is an essential resource for researchers and students of social psychology and related disciplines.",

Dave Mearns and Brian Thorne explain the theoretical principles of the person-centred approach by relating these principles to actual practice. Drawing on one particular case-study the two counsellors present an extensive exploration of the core conditions of empathy, acceptance and congruence, and provide a step-by-step account of both the counsellor's and the client's experience of being involved in a trusting, caring relationship characterised by power-sharing and mutuality.",

    "description": "Colin Mathers who leads the Global Burden of Disease group in WHO has confirmed that, in the 2004 GBD, 13.1% of global Daily Adjusted Life Years are attributable to mental or neurological disorders. While the proportions vary very widely from about 10% in low income countries to over 25% in high income countries, it is clear that there is a need for understanding how to address this issue. This volume aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the public health principles of mental and neurological disorders. This vast range of health conditions affects people across the life course, from developmental disabilities in childhood, to schizophrenia and substance abuse in adults, and dementia in old age. Despite this diversity, they all share many features: they are mostly mediated through brain dysfunction or abnormalities, are often chronic in course, typically benefit from multi-component interventions, and are amongst the most neglected conditions in global health. The volume will bring together chapters from the Psychiatry, Neurology, Substance Abuse and Child Development sections of the Encyclopedia of Public Health. The volume will be the first comprehensive text on a public health approach to this diverse group of health conditions and has no obvious competitor. Highlights the common features of many mental and neurological disorders Provides insights into potential \"cross-over\" methods of identification and treatment Includes chapters on the most frequently diagnosed mental and neurological challenges faced by public health systems",

    "description": "Person-centred therapy, rooted in the experience and ideas of the eminent psychotherapist Carl Rogers, is widely practised in the UK and throughout the world. It has applications in health and social care, the voluntary sector and is relevant to work with people who are severely mentally and emotionally distressed. As well as being a valuable sourcebook and offering a comprehensive overview, this edition includes updated references and a new section on recent developments and advances. The book begins with a consideration of the principles and philosophy underpinning person-centred therapy before moving to a comprehensive discussion of the classical theory upon which practice is based. Further areas of discussion include: The model of the person, including the origins of mental and emotional distress The process of constructive change A review of revisions of and additions to person-centred theory Child development, styles of processing and configurations of self The quality of presence and working at relational depth Criticisms of the approach are addressed and rebutted and the application of theory to practice is discussed. The new final section is concerned with advances and developments in theory and practice including: Counselling for Depression The Social Dimension to Person-Centred Therapy Person-Centred Practice with People experiencing Severe and Enduring Distress and at the ‘Difficult Edge’ A Review of Research Throughout the book, attention is drawn to the wider person-centred literature to which it is a valuable key. Person-Centred Therapy will be of particular use to students, scholars and practitioners of person-centred therapy as well as to anyone who wants to know more about one of the major psychotherapeutic modalities.",

    "description": "Since the celebration of the 100th anniversary of Darwin's The Language of the Emotions in Man and Animals (1872), emotionology has become a respectable and even thriving research domain again. The domain of human emotions is most important for mankind, emotions being right in the center of our daily lives and interests. A key-role in the interdisciplinary scientific debate about emotions has now been accorded to the study of the language of emotions. The present volume offers a new approach to the study of the language of emotions insofar as it presents theories from very different perspectives. It encompasses studies by scholars from diverse disciplines such as linguistics, sociology, and psychology. The topics of the contributions also cover a range of special fields of interest in four major sections. In a first section, a discussion of theoretical issues in the analysis of emotions is presented. The conceptualization of emotions in specific cultures is analyzed in section 2. Section 3 takes a different inroad into the language of emotions by looking at developmental approaches giving evidence of the fact that the acquisition of the language of emotions is a social achievement that simultaneously determines our experience of these emotions. Section 4 is devoted to emotional language in action, that is, the contributions focus upon different types of texts and analyze how emotions are referred to and expressed in discourse.",

    "description": "`It is... particularly useful that main points are summarised in tables, making this a very easy-to-read book. It is evident from the way the material is presented that the authors are experienced therapists, who have a deep understanding of the cognitive therapy process per se and the applications of cognitive theory in general. Case studies are presented throughout the book to illustrate the theory, offering valuable educational material to the readers. The book has also been written with an open mind, providing a balanced overview of both the strengths and limitations of an evidence-based therapeutic model. I believe that it will make a useful source for all those professionals who wish to introduce themselves to cognitive therapy as well as an excellent introductory training textbook' - Accident and Emergency Nursing `This is an excellent summary of the current status of cognitive therapy, describing as it does both the basic approach, tools and techniques of the 'traditional' model, and the more recent developments in the field. It is well organized and easy to read, usefully illustrated with case examples, and each chapter is supported by a specific further reading list. In my view, it is appropriate for both the cognitive therapist in training and for the more experienced therapist who wants a stimulating and helpful summary of the new ideas in the area, and wants to reflect on therapeutic process as much as content' - Clinical Child Psychology and Psychiatry `This volume should be the first stop for mental health practitioners from all disciplines looking for an introduction to the basic art and ideas of cognitive therapy' - Adrian Wells, Professor in Clinical Psychology, University of Manchester Diana Sanders and Frank Wills explain the central concepts on which cognitive therapy is based and describe how the model can effectively be put into practice. They take the reader through the stages of the therapeutic process, emphasizing the practical skills involved and providing examples to illustrate each stage in the process. Reflecting recent developments in both theory and practice, the Second Edition of Cognitive Therapy has been fully revised and presents an up-to-date picture of how therapeutic change takes place across a 'network' of cognitive, emotional and behavioural functioning, reinforcing the holistic trend identified in the first edition. This edition also features new sections on: - applications of cognitive therapy - metacognition - mindfulness - the therapeutic relationship, and - behavioural experiments. As an accessible introduction to contemporary theory and practice, Cognitive Therapy is an ideal text for those working - or training to work - in the psychological therapies and mental health. Diana Sanders is Consultant Counselling Psychologist, Clinical Associate, Oxford Cognitive Therapy Centre, and Principal Counselling Psychologist, Department of Psychological Medicine, Oxfordshire Mental Healthcare NHS Trust. Frank Wills is and Independent Cognitive Psychotherapist, Bristol and Tutor, University of Wales Newport.",

    "description": "Tim Lewens aims to understand what it means to take an evolutionary approach to cultural change, and why it is that this approach is often treated with suspicion. Convinced of the exceptional power of natural selection, many thinkers—typically working in biological anthropology, cognitive psychology, and evolutionary biology—have suggested it should be freed from the confines of biology, and applied to cultural change in humans and other animals. At the same time, others-typically with backgrounds in disciplines like social anthropology and history-have been just as vocal in dismissing the evolutionary approach to culture. What drives these disputes over Darwinism in the social sciences? While making a case for the value of evolutionary thinking for students of culture, Lewens shows why the concerns of sceptics should not dismissed as mere prejudice, confusion, or ignorance. Indeed, confusions about what evolutionary approaches entail are propagated by their proponents, as well as by their detractors. By taking seriously the problems faced by these approaches to culture, Lewens shows how such approaches can be better formulated, where their most significant limitations lie, and how the tools of cultural evolutionary thinking might become more widely accepted.",

First published in 1946, and now inits Seventh Edition, the Handbook has long been consideredthe definitive guide to the field of developmental science. Volume 3: Social, Emotional, and Personality Developmentpresentsup-to-date knowledge and theoretical understanding of theseveral facets of social, emotional and personality processes. Thevolume emphasizes that any specific processes, function, orbehavior discussed in the volume co-occurs alongside and isinextricably affected by the dozens of other processes, functions,or behaviors that are the focus of other researchers' work. As aresult, the volume underscores the importance of a focus on thewhole developing child and his or her sociocultural and historicalenvironment. Understand the multiple processes that are interrelated inpersonality development Discover the individual, cultural, social, and economicprocesses that contribute to the social, emotional, and personalitydevelopment of individuals Learn about the several individual and contextual contributionsto the development of such facets of the individual as morality,spirituality, or aggressive/violent behavior Study the processes that contribute to the development ofgender, sexuality, motivation, and social engagement The scholarship within this volume and, as well, across the fourvolumes of this edition, illustrate that developmental science isin the midst of a very exciting period. There is a paradigm shiftthat involves increasingly greater understanding of how todescribe, explain, and optimize the course of human life fordiverse individuals living within diverse contexts. ThisHandbook is the definitive reference for educators,policy-makers, researchers, students, and practitioners in humandevelopment, psychology, sociology, anthropology, andneuroscience.",
