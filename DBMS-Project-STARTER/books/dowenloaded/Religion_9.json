    "description": "This compact book for laity introduces the major concepts of the Christian faith in a quick, easy-to-read fashion. The author begins with a brief overview of Christian history from biblical times to the present, with references to key people and events that shaped the faith. He follows this with sections on God, Jesus, and the Holy Spirit. For each of these topics, he sketches the basic ideas of the Bible and then shows how Christians in different centuries and contexts have applied these ideas to their own lives and circumstances. Author James White shows us the variety of Christian ideas about God but puts it all in order so that laypeople can understand how it all fits together. The end result is an inspiring overview of Christianity in its theological diversity and its continuing relevance for today, showing believers just how rich this deep tradition of faith can be. The book includes discussion questions and a glossary and is ideal for use in adult study groups.",

As I look back on my life, I see that God has guided me through every season. Every time He as prepared to move me into a time of healing and restoration, it has been preceded by the “wait.” Though seemingly mundane, the “wait” is one of the most significant times during which God does His best work. If you are a dreamer, a new entrepreneur, a go-getter, or are driven and ambitious, this devotional is for you. If you have ever felt stuck in the process of bringing a dream to life or waiting on God to come through for you, this devotional is for you. And, if you know you are called to live a life of meaning and purpose, this devotional is absolutely for you. I pray that this devotional journal will carry you through the challenging and drawn-out moments of life, that it will stir the deep wells within you and position you to walk with clarity and focus.",

    "description": "First and Second Samuel tell the story of the beginnings of monarchy in ancient Israel. These two powerful narratives present many great figures of biblical history 'Samuel, Saul, and David 'and explore the complex interaction of historical developments and human fidelity under God. In the books of Samuel, characters interact to influence and persuade, to express motivation and desire, and to shape the reader's understanding of the issues that faced the Israelites as they responded to God's invitation to covenant. Through the medium of story, the reader shares in the perennial struggle to discover, in the midst of personal and political conflict, God's ways for humanity.",

Barth's theology found its expression mainly through his closely reasoned fourteen-part magnum opus, Die Kirchliche Dogmatik. Having taken over 30 years to write, the Church Dogmatics is regarded as one of the most important theological works of all time, and represents the pinnacle of Barth's achievement as a theologian. T&T Clark International is now proud to be publishing the only complete English translation of the Church Dogmatics in paperback.",

     "David F. Kelly"

    "publisher": "Georgetown University Press",
    "publishedDate": "2006-10-01",
    "description": "For over thirty years, David F. Kelly has worked with medical practitioners, students, families, and the sick and dying to confront the difficult and often painful issues that concern medical treatment at the end of life. In this short and practical book, Kelly shares his vast experience, providing a rich resource for thinking about life's most painful decisions. Kelly outlines eight major issues regarding end-of-life care as seen through the lens of the Catholic medical ethics tradition. He looks at the distinction between ordinary and extraordinary means; the difference between killing and allowing to die; criteria of patient competence; what to do in the case of incompetent patients; the meaning and use of advance directives; the morality of hydration and nutrition; physician-assisted suicide and euthanasia; and medical futility. Kelly's analysis is sprinkled with significant legal decisions and, throughout, elaborations on how the Catholic medical ethics tradition—as well as teachings of bishops and popes—understands each issue. He provides a helpful glossary to supplement his introduction to the terminology used by philosophical health care ethics. Included in Kelly's discussion is his lucid description of why the Catholic tradition supports the discontinuation of medical care in the Terry Schiavo case. He also explores John Paul II's controversial papal allocution concerning hydration and nutrition for unconscious patients, arguing that the Catholic tradition does not require feeding the permanently unconscious. Medical Care at the End of Life addresses the major issues that inform this last stage of caregiving. It offers a critical guide to understanding the medical ethics and relevant legal cases needed for clear thinking when individuals are faced with those crucial decisions.",

    "description": "We are holy women. We are smart women. We are beautiful women. So, why are we still single women? Let's tell the truth; it's easy for us to quote the scripture, 'Wait on the Lord and be of good courage and He shall strengthen thy heart,' but after a while, you don't want to hear that anymore. As a matter of fact, your toes curl; your spine tingles; the hair on the back of your neck rises; and you cringe when someone quotes that scripture to you in answer to your singleness—especially if that someone is married. If it wasn't for the truth of the Word of God, you would tell them to shut up and go away.' Life Won't Wait is for those women who are tired of waiting for Mr. Right to come along. Marriage is a God-given, innate desire; however, when the desire to be married becomes an obsession we can lose focus on the purpose for which God has allowed us to be single. We find ourselves wasting countless hours feeling depression, wallowing in self-pity, and complaining. But we must realize that we need to seek the most productive and meaningful single life possible. You can live a full, productive, and victorious single life to the glory and honor of God! You can have the testimony of being a focused, single Christian woman!",

The Arnold Estate, located just beyond the village of Harrisville, Rhode Island seemed the idyllic setting in which to raise a family. The couple unwittingly moved their five young daughters into the ancient and mysterious farmhouse. Time suddenly became irrelevant; fractured by spirits making their presence known then dispersing into the ether. The house is a portal to the past and a passage to the future. Come inside....",

The Most Reverend Frank T. Griswold, Presiding Bishop of the Episcopal Church, has written a foreword that complements the work of contributors such as S. W. Sykes, Richard A. Norris Jr., and George Tavard, among others. Though these articles differ in individual subject, they cohere in their relation to Dr. Wright's expertise as a theologian, a historian, a medievalist, an ecumenist, and above all a man of the church.",

    "description": "Women have \"fallen\" in love with Jesus and learned to \"live\" in love with Him, now it's time to study the depths of that love. Based on the Gospel of John, this study explores the seven descriptions of Jesus as: The Word The Bridegroom The Bread of Life The Lion of Judah The Resurrection and the Life The Vine The Redeemer These seven parallel portraits of Christ are also found in the book of Hosea. It is by studying the richness of these descriptions found in both the Old and New Testaments that our understanding increases and our love deepens in a more meaningful way. Forever in Love with Jesus will be accompanied by the simultaneous release of an in-depth workbook that has additional insights and questions for personal and group study. A video curriculum is scheduled to release in 2005. Dee and Kathy are fast becoming known for their unique style of presentation in both writing and live presentations. Beth Moore says, \"God is using Dee and Kathy in a revival happening in the hearts of countless women. He is stirring the flame of fiery love through His Word-their Falling in Love with Jesus Trilogy has the rare blend of sacred romance and earthly relevance.\"",

After many years of writing in her prayer journal, missionary Sarah Young decided to \"listen\" to God with pen in hand, writing down whatever she believed He was saying to her. It was awkward at first, but gradually her journaling changed from monologue to dialogue. She knew her writings were not inspired as Scripture is, but journaling helped her grow closer to God. Others were blessed as she shared her writings, until people all over the world were using her messages. They are written from Jesus' point of view, thus the title Jesus Calling. It is Sarah's fervent prayer that our Savior may bless readers with His presence and His peace in ever deeper measure.",

    "description": "The Triune God: Philosophical Concepts and Facts is a book I wrote after thorough preparation. While I was studying the Bible through the years I met many obstacles. Those obstacles were questions in my mind about the Triune God. I searched for decades to find the answers. I realized that the scholars didn't answer the questions but they were trying to convince us that there is a mystery for every question and they never had direct answers. In this book I answer questions such as these, \"How can we imagine with a simple example the existence of the Triune God? If God planned everything, why are we punished? Is there inconsistency between God's plan and the sinner's punishment or the sinner's free will? Do we have a free will? Do we resemble God? Is it possible Jesus was God and a human being at the same time? If Jesus was a human being, was it possible for the human body to ascend into heaven and to become invisible? Was Jesus only a human being or just a prophet? Is it possible for a human being or a prophet to order a dead man to walk out of his tomb or to order the storm to stop without praying earlier and publicly to God to make these miracles happen?\" The answers are from the Bible and the Bible affects us all. My book points out answers for all of the mysteries I questioned through the years for anyone to consider when he or she thinks about God.",

Barth's theology found its expression mainly through his closely reasoned fourteen-part magnum opus, Die Kirchliche Dogmatik. Having taken over 30 years to write, the Church Dogmatics is regarded as one of the most important theological works of all time, and represents the pinnacle of Barth's achievement as a theologian. T&T Clark International is now proud to be publishing the only complete English translation of the Church Dogmatics in paperback.",

    "description": "Isnt the fundamental problem at the root of all others we are facing in our world today how to make room for each and every person to be counted as an equal, to be validated for his or her own unique personhood, and to live with every other person in a harmony and unity in which each is respectful of self, others, and the environment in which she or he lives? In Making Room, author Linda Rex invites us to experience a prayerful rediscovery of the roots of our humanity within the Trinity, the God in whose image we were created. Drawing upon the nature of God as Father, Son, and Holy Spiritand the incarnation of the Word of God in the person of Jesus ChristLinda points us back to the fundamentals of our humanity and to our need to live within the truth of who we are in Christ: the beloved children of God. Something substantial can be missed when we do not look at Christ and our humanity in a way that takes into account the nature and being of the God who created humanity to bear his likeness. And while Christianity is often seen today as a cause of division and suffering rather than the source of healing and unity, perhaps instead of rejecting Christianity, what we need most is to reexamine who Jesus is and what it means to be a follower of Christ.",

    "description": "A Seasoned Journalist Chases Down the Biggest Story in History Is there credible evidence that Jesus of Nazareth really is the Son of God? Retracing his own spiritual journey from atheism to faith, Lee Strobel, former legal editor of the Chicago Tribune, cross-examines a dozen experts with doctorates from schools like Cambridge, Princeton, and Brandeis who are recognized authorities in their own fields. Strobel challenges them with questions like How reliable is the New Testament? Does evidence for Jesus exist outside the Bible? Is there any reason to believe the resurrection was an actual event? Strobel's tough, point-blank questions make this Gold Medallion-winning book read like a captivating, fast-paced novel. But it's not fiction. It's a riveting quest for the truth about history's most compelling figure. What will your verdict be in The Case for Christ? 'Lee Strobel probes with bulldog-like tenacity the evidence for the truth of biblical Christianity.' Bruce M. Metzger, Ph.D., Professor of New Testament, Emeritus, Princeton Theological Seminary 'Lee Strobel asks the questions a tough-minded skeptic would ask. His book is so good I read it out loud to my wife evenings after dinner. Every inquirer should have it.' Phillip E. Johnson, Law Professor, University of California at Berkeley",

Within these pages are not only words but they are experiences, dreams, obstacles... and testimonies of triumph. Throughout our lives there are things that we keep inside that we should Speak Up about. There are situations and injustices that we should Speak Out about. Then there are times when we speak and we still can not be heard...at that time I suggest you shout if you have to! Poetry is life and Life is Poetry, so step outside your box, claim your victory as Random Thought has done poetically. The Stage is set...Speak Up, Speak Out...Shout if you have to!

    "description": "The world is increasingly becoming . one. It is, at the same time, one endangered ecosystem and one thriving market place with material and spiritual goods on competitive display. And the good and evil things of life cannot easily be sorted out. The world is becoming one also in the sense that it is better understood today than it was in earlier times, that the material good and the spiritual good, though seemingly belonging to different realms of fact defined by their respective modes of existence, together constitute effectively one and the same reality: the modem world of science, technology, computerized administration and power, that calls upon humankind to struggle for a 'just, participatory and sustainable society' * , and to strive for a society of the future that will be the world over both long-lived and worth living. The Second European Conference on Science and Religion, held on 10-13th. March, 1988, on the campus of the Universiteit Twente, Enschede, The Netherlands, was meant to be a modest market place, a forum, where standpoints and opinions could be presented and criticized. It was meant to offer an opportunity to meet and to make acquaintances in the expectation that the exchange of thoughts would lead to new conceptual horizons that would challenge what so far had been considered as hard fact or what until now had been looked upon as a distinctive feature of a well-established view either of the kingdom of the sciences or of the realm of religion.",
