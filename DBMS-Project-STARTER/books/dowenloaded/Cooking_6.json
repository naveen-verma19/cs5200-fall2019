    "description": "Teenage foodie Joshua Weissman lost over 100 pounds just by turning from trendy diets to real food. Now he shares how he developed a sensible, yet still indulgent, philosophy of eating for health and happiness, along with some of his favorite recipes. For decades, the food industry has misconstrued valid viewpoints about healthful ways of eating, sometimes leading the public even further from good health. For this and many other reasons, we have become increasingly disconnected from the food we eat. In The Slim Palate Paleo Cookbook, teenage food blogger Joshua Weissman, who lost more than 100 pounds by eating real food, shares some of his favorite recipes, along with his philosophy on food. This book focuses on the use of whole foods and on eating for happiness and health. Whether you’re trying to lose weight, you want to be healthier, or you just love food, The Slim Palate Paleo Cookbook brings it all to the table with more than 100 recipes that will appeal to inexperienced and advanced home cooks alike. The Slim Palate Paleo Cookbook includes recipes that everyone can enjoy making and eating that are free of grain, gluten, and refined sugar—ingredients that are all too common in our Western diet but can be real roadblocks on the path to wellness. Healthful food does not inherently taste bland or bad; Joshua proves just that with recipes such as an irresistible Rolled Pork Loin lined with fresh and fragrant herbs, a hearty Shepherd’s Pie topped with a creamy cauliflower mash, and a flavorful Steak and Brussels Sprouts Stir-Fry. Vegetable dishes such as Braised Leeks and Artichoke Hearts and Grilled Eggplant and Tomato Stacks will show you new ways to cook and enjoy your favorite veggies, and maybe even find a new favorite.",

    "description": "For the first time in one book, Techniques in Home Wine Making provides detailed instructions for producing premium-quality home-made wines - wines that will impress even the most astute connoisseurs. Daniel Pambianchi demystifies the principles of winemaking, for both beginner and advanced home winemakers, with thorough, step-by-step descriptions and realistic advice. By using practical techniques, processes, and equipment adapted from traditional and modern commercial winemaking, excellent age-worthy wines can be made at home. Easy-to-follow instructions are also provided for making impressive sparkling wine (including using the traditional méthod champenoise process), vintage-style port wine, and the now world-famous ice wine. In this new edition of Techniques in Home Winemaking, author Daniel Pambianchi has completely updated all aspects of his indispensable book and has added an additional 30 pages. Expanded sections describe the instruments and procedures for monitoring and controlling acid, pH and sulphite levels; introduces newly-available winemaking equipment; provides step-by-step instructions for making world-class sparkling wines; discusses winemaking problems; and includes numerous new pictures and diagrams. \"There's in-depth detail here that I have previously seen only in professional texts: the inside scoop on alcoholic fermentation; on fining and filtration; on the malolactic fermentation; on the care and maintenance of oak barrels; on avoiding and treating winemaking problems; and on the making of sparkling port and ice wines. I just wish Daniel Pambianchi's book was available when I was just starting out as a winemaker ... it could have saved me a lot of trial and error along the way! —Thomas Bachelder Thomas Bachelder is currently a winemaker at Lemelson Winery in Oregon, and he has made wine for several different Domaines in Burgundy, France. He is the author of five books on wine, and is a regular columnist for Wine Tidings Magazine.",

    "description": "Rohan Anderson is all about cooking and eating real food. Food that has grown with the seasons and off the land that he's tended, or wild food that can be hunted and foraged from the fields and the bush. This is Rohan's year of living in practiculture: his observations, victories and failures, questions and opinions, and over 100 delicious recipes that in total record the reality of living a practical, more sustainable life. Rohan Anderson left his desk job in the city for the richer pleasures of living a simpler life on the land. Over the years he has developed his own principle of practical living. Practiculture is a lifestyle choice. It's about direct involvement in the day-to-day elements of living, and at the heart of it, the rewarding choice to grow, hunt and forage beautiful, healthy and sustainable food. A Year of Practiculture features 100 of Rohan's simple, rustic, seasonal recipes along with a collection of honest stories and experiences of Rohan and his young family as they learn the realities of living a practical life surrounded by the bounty (and hardships) of the land through the seasons. Written in Rohan's passionate, funny and no-nonsense style, he uses a mixture of humor and poetic writing to tackle the deeper issues that our modern food system raises. Recipes include rabbit backstrap with spring morel and sage; cold smoked bacon; grilled broccoli, almond and sriracha salad; salmon with pimenton crust and chili aoili; bottling fruit; elderflower cordial; crumbed quail with roast beetroot mash; sourdough bread; venison port pie and more! This is the ultimate guide to living on the land in modern times, illustrated throughout with stunning photographs of the landscape through the seasons and the recipes created from it.",

    "title": "The Macros Approach",
    "authors": [
     "Christine Hronec"
    ],
    "publisher": "Victory Belt Publishing",
    "publishedDate": "2017-06-27",
    "description": "•The Macros Diet (IIFYM) has a core of adherents in the bodybuilding and weightloss world. Hundreds of thousand of people have achieved their health and weight loss goals via the macros diet. •The purpose of this book is for readers to understand the concept of using macronutrients to index their meal planning efforts to reach their ultimate health and fitness goals. People are confused by the surplus of popular exclusion diets in mass media. I want the masses to learn 3 things: 1.) That they do not need to be at an extreme caloric deficit to support fat loss 2.) That they can eat generous ports of real foods, and 3.) That the macros based approach is a real lifestyle change and is not just a “quick fix” band-aid approach to poor nutrition. •The whole trend of meal prep was once a characteristic “bro-diet” of the bodybuilding competitor community. With the explosion of instagram in the last 4 years, fitness competitions are no longer a thing just for men, and bikini competitions have become the new “marathon” goal for females. This has led to a refreshed approach to meal planning with new “macro friendly” recipes, videos, and blogs popping up daily and online coaches and nutrition gurus being made by the day because they posted a good “selfie.” This trend is not going away and more and more people are adapting the meal planning and “macros” based approach using a growing popular trend called “iifym” which stands for “if it fits your macros” and using macros tracking apps such as myfitnesspal to stay within their daily macro goals for the day. •IIFMY does not focus on absolute strict adherence to food choices; but more an aggregate of food choices over time, always making sure to meet your macros and adjust back to healthier choices of making less healthy choices. •The goal of the Macros diet is to match your fat, protein, and carbohydrate intake to known, reliable ratios that help you lose weight or maintain muscle mass. Once you know your idea ratio of fat to protein to carbs, you simply track those macronutrients in each of your meals, aiming to hit your desired total ratio daily. •Macros diet originated in with bodybuilders in the 1970s[S1] but is now utilized by a wide variety of elite athletes include Samantha Briggs (Crossfit 2013 fittest woman on Earth) and Joe Ames (Crossfit 2015 Master division winner). •Why Macros Matter is a no-nonsense guide on how to utilize a macro counting meal plans and bulk food preparation in order to meeting your macronutrient goals. •Christine focuses on the practical application of how to count macros in your day to day life; utilizing easy to operate phone apps to record your daily intake and massive comprehensive meal plans to plan meals ahead of time, she shows the reader how IIFMY dieting is an easy to track method of meeting your goals. •Christine has a background in chemistry, and a track record of coaching people to wins in phyqiue competitions, making her uniquely qualified to speak to the theoretical and practical methods of improving your body and your health through diet. •Christine will promote the book through her largest platforms that include Instagram and YouTube. She recently put more emphasis on her YouTube channel and had seen the highest degree of engagement with this platform. She plans to announce new programs, discuss technical questions about nutrition, and answer complex questions that will be covered in this book via those channels •Christine has also been featured in Flex Magazine, Muscle and Strength and various podcasts. We see a lot of opportunity for her to penetrate the mainstream publications with her messaging and recipe share The go-to system for dieting has long been counting calories: to lose weight, you need to eat fewer calories than you use for fuel. But monitoring your caloric intake can only take you so far. It’s not how many calories you consume but the kinds of calories that ultimately determines if you reach your physique goal, whether that’s weight loss, fat loss, weight gain, or lean muscle gain. And knowing what your food is made of and using that information to eat better is the basis of the macros approach to nutrition. Macronutrients, or “macros,” are what food is made of: protein, carbohydrates, and fat. You can customize the ratio of these macros exactly for your fitness and physique goals. And as fitness expert and nutrition scientist Christine Hronec reveals, it doesn’t mean eating only broiled chicken breast or steamed broccoli. In Why Macros Matter, Hronec explains how the “if it fits your macros,” or IIFYM, diet gives you the freedom to eat whatever you want while still meeting your fitness goals. As long as you stick to your personal daily macros ratio, you can have that slice of pizza or scoop of ice cream. It’s not magic or wishful thinking—it’s based on sound, proven science, and it’s revolutionized how elite athletes train and perform. Hronec brings the macros approach from the realm of personal trainers and nutritionists to everyday life by emphasizing meal planning and food preparation. With these two tools, it’s easy to customize your meals to match your fitness and physique goals, even while working full-time and training daily. Why Macros Matter does the work for you with dozens of customizable meal plans, all centered around specific macro ratios. And even better, Hronec puts you in the driver’s seat by offering multiple options for every food. Tired of chicken? There are fish options with the exact same of protein and carbs. It’s time to step away from restrictive, frustrating diets and enjoy your favorite foods again—while still getting the body you want and train for.",

    "description": "Almost every culture on earth has drink, and where there's drink there's drunkenness. But in every age and in every place drunkenness is a little bit different. It can be religious, it can be sexual, it can be the duty of kings or the relief of peasants. It can be an offering to the ancestors, or a way of marking the end of a day's work. It can send you to sleep, or send you into battle. A Short History of Drunkenness traces humankind's love affair with booze from our primate ancestors through to Prohibition, answering every possible question along the way: What did people drink? How much? Who did the drinking? Of the many possible reasons, why? On the way, learn about the Neolithic Shamans, who drank to communicate with the spirit world (no pun intended), marvel at how Greeks got giddy and Romans got rat-arsed, and find out how bars in the Wild West were never quite like in the movies. This is a history of the world at its inebriated best.",

The secret ingredient that makes Indian food truly Indian is the generous use of signature spices. From ancient times of the maharaja’s, spices have added unforgettable flavours and life to Indian cuisine. Indian spices offer significant health benefits and contribute towards an individual's healthy life. They add flavor and nutrients to dishes without fat or calories! A spice may be available in several forms: fresh, whole dried, or pre-ground dried. Generally, spices are dried. A spice is a seed, fruit, root, bark, berry, bud or other vegetable substance primarily used for flavoring, coloring or preserving food. Spices are distinguished from herbs, which are parts of leafy green plants used for flavoring or as a garnish. Many spices have antimicrobial properties. Spices produce a vast and diverse assortment of organic compounds, the great majority of which do not appear to participate directly in growth and development. There are a large number of various spices, used along with food such as Chilli (Mirchi), Turmeric (Haldi), Coriander (Dhania), Cumin (Jeera), Mustard (Rai), Fenugreek (Methi), Sesame (Til), Cardamon, Peppercorns (Kali Mirchi), Clove, Fennel (Saunf), Nutmeg and Mace etc. These spices give taste to the prepared food and at the same time give attractive colours and smell to the food. Today, Indian spices are the most sought-after globally, given their exquisite aroma, texture, taste and medicinal value. India has the largest domestic market for spices in the world. Traditionally, spices in India have been grown in small land holdings, with organic farming gaining prominence in recent times. India is the world's largest producer, consumer and exporter of spices. Demand for Indian spices is high because they are clean and hygienic as compared to that of other countries. In modern times, international trade in spices and condiments have increased dramatically which could be attributed to several factors including rapid advances in transportation, permitting easy accessibility to world markets, growing demand from industrial food manufacturers of wide ranging convenience foods which are either ready to eat or requiring minimal preparation time in the household, migration of large number of people of different ethnicity with their traditional food habits, to meet the changing requirements of industry and commerce and exposure to culinary delicacies of other regions of the world by increasing business and tourism travel.

    "description": "THE SUNDAY TIMES BESTSELLER 'For bung-it-in-the-oven cooks everywhere, this is a must-have book: Diana Henry has a genius for flavour.' - Nigella Lawson Whether you're short of time or just prefer to keep things simple, From the Oven to the Table shows how the oven can do much of the work that goes into making great food. Diana Henry's favourite way to cook is to throw ingredients into a dish or roasting tin, slide them in the oven and let the heat behind that closed door transform them into golden, burnished meals. Most of the easy-going recipes in this wonderfully varied collection are cooked in one dish; some are ideas for simple accompaniments that can be cooked on another shelf at the same time. From quick after-work suppers to feasts for friends, the dishes are vibrant and modern and focus on grains, pulses and vegetables as much as meat and fish. With recipes such as Chicken Thighs with Miso, Sweet Potatoes & Spring Onions, Roast Indian-spiced Vegetables with Lime-Coriander Butter, and Roast Stone Fruit with Almond and Orange Flower Crumbs, Diana shows how the oven is the most useful bit of kit you have in your kitchen. Praise for How to Eat a Peach: 'This is an extraordinary piece of food writing, pitch perfect in every way. I couldn't love anyone who didn't love this book.' - Nigella Lawson '...her best yet...superb menus evoking place and occasion with consummate elegance' - Financial Times Food Book of the Year at the André Simon Food & Drink Book Awards 2019",

    "publisher": "Weldon Owen",
    "publishedDate": "2019-09-17",
    "description": "This is the first official cookbook from the Downton Abbey series, with 300 million viewers worldwide and the most sucessful British series of all time, and timed to coincide with the release of the Downton Abbey movie in September 2019. This engaging and historically accurate cookbook presents more than 100 recipes that showcase the intrinsic role of food in the Crawley household and narrative—and bring this exciting gastronomic time to modern kitchens and Downton fans. The period between 1912 and 1926, when Downton Abbey is set, was a tumultuous one and marked by numerous significant historical events and huge technological advances. Culuturally it was a time of jazz, art deco, and evolving Victorian values. Across all six seasons of Downton, the impact of these events and developments—on the Crawleys and their wider household—are visible: Downton Abbey looks solid and never changing, but this was an era in which everything changed, and did so very fast. Food, too, underwent change from the late Edwardian era to the swinging twenties, and it was an especially exciting time gastronomically. The food of the Edwardian era, which has a modern reputation for being heavy, rich, and reliant on aspic, was phenomenal. This was the key period for the codification of French haute cuisine, and many of the dishes and techniques that are still regarded as intrinsic to classical French cooking today were developed at this time. British cooking was also quite good—raised pies, syllabubs, trifles, and roast meats were very popular and seen as quintessentially English, and roast beef and Yorkshire pudding was already a national dish. The recipes included here reflect all the influences found on the Downton Abbey tables, upstairs and down. They are adapted from original recipes published or written down between 1875 and 1930 and have all been chosen to be easily made in a modern kitchen. Some are as seen on screen, some are alluded to, and others are typical of the time. They would all be at home in a stately dining room, with candles and gold and tightly corseted female figures. But more important, they would be at home as part of a twenty-first-century meal as well. These are historic recipes, and they are Downton recipes, but they are also delicious modern recipes. Recipes Include Kedgeree Sardine Salad Orange Layer Cake Hot Cross Buns Turbot with Hollandaise Sauce Artichoke and Asparagus Salad The Queen of Trifles Lamb Stew with Semolina Steamed Treacle Pudding Gingerbread Cake",

    "description": "From awkward schoolgirl to Caterer to the Stars, Mary Giuliani weaves together a collection of hilarious memories, from professional growing pains to her long journey to motherhood, never losing her sense of humor and her love for everyone's favorite party food, pigs in a blanket. Mary's utterly unremarkable childhood was everything she didn't want: hailing from a deeply loving yet overprotective Italian family in an all-Jewish enclave on Long Island. All she wanted was to fit in (be Jewish) and become famous (specifically a cast member on Saturday Night Live). With an easy, natural storytelling sensibility, Mary shares her journey from a cosseted childhood home to the stage and finally to the party, accidentally landing what she now refers to as \"the breakthrough role of a lifetime\" catering to a glittery list of stars she once hoped to be part of herself. Fresh, personal, and full of Mary's humorous, self-deprecating, and can-do attitude against all odds, you'll want to see where each shiny silver tray of hors d'oeuvres takes her next. You never know when the humble hot dog will be a crucial ingredient in the recipe for success, in building a business or simply making life more delicious.",

    "description": "Das 20:80-Prinzip – endlich erfolgreich abnehmen Sie möchten überflüssige Kilos loswerden? Und das ganz ohne lästige Jojo-Spielchen? Mit „Abnehmen nach dem 20:80-Prinzip“ bringt Sie Dr. Matthias Riedl endlich auf Erfolgskurs. Der bekannte Ernährungs-Doc aus dem TV hat anhand neuester ernährungswissenschaftlicher Kenntnisse einen Ernährungsplan aufgestellt, mit dem Sie gesund abnehmen. Und zwar genau Sie – denn das 20:80-Prinzip funktioniert ganz individuell. Hungern, einschränken, verbieten? Diese Worte gehören nicht ins Konzept. Sie behalten 80 Prozent Ihrer Essgewohnheiten bei und ändern nur 20 Prozent Ihres Verhaltens. So werden und bleiben Sie auf Dauer schlank! Der Ernährungsplan für gesundes Abnehmen: Ihr Buch auf einen Blick Das erwartet Sie im GU-Buch „Abnehmen nach dem 20:80-Prinzip“: Theorie – Einführung: Wie das völlig neue Abnehmprinzip funktioniert und worauf Sie achten sollten Theorie – Ernährungs-Analyse: Selbstcheck in Sachen Ernährung, den eigenen Esstyp bestimmen und danach handeln lernen Theorie – Abnehmplan: Gewohnheiten ändern mithilfe des individuellen Ernährungsplans, Tipps und Tricks für kleine Krisen, detaillierte Einkaufsliste für Vorräte, Beispiel-Essensplan für die erste Woche und noch mehr Abspeck-Know-how Rezepte – Frühstück: Schlankes Knuspermüsli, Hüttenkäsecreme mit Beeren, Kokos-Skyr mit Obstsalat und mehr Rezepte – Zwischenmahlzeiten: Gemüse-Hack-Bällchen, Mediterrane Paprikaröllchen, Mango-Curry-Eier und mehr Rezepte – kalte Hauptmahlzeiten: Avocadosalat mit Hähnchen, Mediterraner Kichererbsensalat, Italienischer Brokkolisalat und mehr Rezepte – warme Hauptmahlzeiten: Kürbissuppe mit Saté-Spießen, Tomatensuppe mit Pinienkernen, Cremige Topinambursuppe und mehr Rezepte – Desserts: Leichtes Tiramisu, Kokoscreme mit Mango, Quarkcreme mit Pfirsich und mehr Erfolgreich abnehmen: Welcher Esstyp sind Sie? Wussten Sie, dass es verschiedene Esstypen gibt? Dürfen wir vorstellen: Der Esspraktiker möchte günstig und schnell an seine Speisen kommen. Der Feinschmecker probiert gern Neues aus, legt Wert auf Qualität und nimmt sich Zeit für gutes Essen. Der Natürlich-Esser setzt auf gesund und biologisch. Beim Kaloriensparer dreht sich alles ums Kalorien-Zählen Und der Gewohnheitsesser hat festgefahrene Verhaltensmuster. Nur, wenn Sie wissen, welche Gewohnheiten Sie bisher an den Tag gelegt haben, finden Sie heraus, was Sie in Zukunft ändern sollten und was Sie beibehalten möchten. Welcher Typ Sie sind, was Sie richtig und was Sie falsch machen, erklärt Dr. Matthias Riedl in „Abnehmen nach dem 20:80-Prinzip“. Mit seinen Tipps und Tricks lernen Sie, langfristig abzunehmen – ohne sich dabei zu quälen. Analysieren Sie sich und Ihre Ernährung mit diesem Buch. Nach und nach stellen Sie mithilfe dieses Ratgebers Ihre (realistischen) Ess-Ziele zusammen. Gesund abnehmen: Ihr eigener Ernährungsplan Eine für alle und alle für eine – bei Diäten funktioniert das nicht. Unser Mediziner und Autor Dr. Riedl ist überzeugt davon, dass jeder Mensch seinen eigenen Ernährungsplan braucht. Sicher haben Sie schon das ein oder andere Abspeckprogramm ausprobiert und danach Bekanntschaft mit dem Jojo-Effekt gemacht. Ein Grund dafür: Jeder hat seine (Ess-) Gewohnheiten, zu denen er früher oder später zurückkehrt. Diese Vorlieben (z. B. das Marmeladenbrötchen zum Frühstück) wollen wir Ihnen mit dem GU-Buch „Abnehmen nach dem 20:80-Prinzip“ gar nicht nehmen, sondern sie nur ein bisschen zurechtschrauben (z. B. einen Teil der Marmelade auf dem Brötchen durch eiweißreichen Quark ersetzen). Und zwar ganz behutsam. Langfristig abnehmen: Tipps und Tricks für gesundes (Satt-) Essen Das Wichtigste am 20:80-Prinzip ist, dass Sie nicht hungern. Der Schlüssel zum Erfolg: Sattessen! Mit viel Eiweiß, Gemüse, gesunden Fetten und weniger Kohlenhydraten klappt das supereinfach. Dr. Matthias Riedl erklärt ganz genau, welche Lebensmittel wie viel Eiweiß enthalten und dadurch ordentlich satt machen. Der speziell für Sie entwickelte Essplan für die erste Woche bietet dann eine gute Starthilfe ins Abnehmprogramm. Montags geht es zum Beispiel los mit Vollkornbrot und Käse-Skyr-Apfel-Belag, mittags gibt’s „Ofengemüse mit Hüttenkäse“ und abends „Lauchsuppe mit Pilzen und Hackfleisch“. Alle Rezepte dazu und viele weitere Gerichte finden Sie natürlich im GU-Buch „Abnehmen nach dem 20:80-Prinzip“. Hier fällt der Startschuss in ein schlankes Leben. Wir wünschen Ihnen viel Erfolg auf Ihrem Weg zum Wunschgewicht!",

    "description": "Award-winning journalist Simran Sethi explores the history and cultural importance of our most beloved tastes, paying homage to the ingredients that give us daily pleasure, while providing a thoughtful wake-up call to the homogenization that is threatening the diversity of our food supply. Food is one of the greatest pleasures of human life. Our response to sweet, salty, bitter, or sour is deeply personal, combining our individual biological characteristics, personal preferences, and emotional connections. Bread, Wine, Chocolate illuminates not only what it means to recognize the importance of the foods we love, but also what it means to lose them. Award-winning journalist Simran Sethi reveals how the foods we enjoy are endangered by genetic erosion—a slow and steady loss of diversity in what we grow and eat. In America today, food often looks and tastes the same, whether at a San Francisco farmers market or at a Midwestern potluck. Shockingly, 95% of the world’s calories now come from only thirty species. Though supermarkets seem to be stocked with endless options, the differences between products are superficial, primarily in flavor and brand. Sethi draws on interviews with scientists, farmers, chefs, vintners, beer brewers, coffee roasters and others with firsthand knowledge of our food to reveal the multiple and interconnected reasons for this loss, and its consequences for our health, traditions, and culture. She travels to Ethiopian coffee forests, British yeast culture labs, and Ecuadoran cocoa plantations collecting fascinating stories that will inspire readers to eat more consciously and purposefully, better understand familiar and new foods, and learn what it takes to save the tastes that connect us with the world around us.",

    "description": "Comida para alegrar a alma Rodrigo Hilbert transporta para seu livro a mesma irreverência com que apresenta o programa Tempero de Família, no canal GNT. As 49 deliciosas receitas desse catarinense vêm embaladas pela filosofia de que é possível chegar à chamada comfort food com ingredientes sem sofisticação, fáceis de encontrar em bons supermercados. Sua marca registrada é mesclar simplicidade no preparo das iguarias e descontração na hora de contar casos divertidos relacionados às receitas. O resultado é uma comida para alegrar a alma. As receitas têm mais que sabores, têm ligações emocionais com a infância, o jeito de cozinhar da mãe, as histórias de família que beiravam o fogão. Rodrigo Hilbert transporta para seu livro, com quarenta e nove receitas e várias fotos incríveis para ensinar a fazer um delicioso salame caseiro ou um bolo de aipim que sua avó servia no café da tarde, a mesma irreverência com que apresenta o programa Tempero de Família, no canal GNT, toda quinta, às 20h. Sua marca registrada é mesclar simplicidade no preparo das iguarias e descontração na hora de contar casos divertidos relacionados às receitas. O resultado é uma comida para alegrar a alma. Com o cheeseburguer, um dos pratos de que mais gosta ao lado da moqueca de corvina, Hilbert tomou gosto pela cozinha. Já o risoto de siri aprendeu com seu tio Rubens, que adora preparar esse prato para uma grande quantidade de pessoas. A feijoada de frutos do mar, que leva também leite de coco, cação e feijão branco, começou a ser feita na base do improviso: quando não havia um ingrediente à mão, era logo substituído por outro. Um prato servido para a família quando está à beira-mar, vem com um aviso do cozinheiro: é bom afofar o sofá para depois do almoço, porque as muitas calorias embutidas na receita levam à indolência. Para além de comentários saborosos sobre cada um dos pratos, Hilbert dá dicas a quem se arrisca a encarar as caçarolas, como a receita de nhoque com recheio de pão: o truque é não deixar nenhum furinho nas bolinhas de massa para que não entre água e não ponha fim ao nhoque crocante. Todas as receitas desse catarinense vêm embaladas pela filosofia de que é possível chegar à chamada comfort food com ingredientes sem sofisticação, fáceis de encontrar em bons supermercados. Um frango caipira ou orgânico para cozinhar a galinha ensopada do domingo, a mistura de farinhas de trigo e de milho para fabricar o talharim em casa e servir de acompanhamento ao frango, o maracujá fresco para se transformar em uma musse geladinha, o sagu com creme de baunilha bem mole para se lambuzar e voltar aos tempos de criança. Receitas que mexem com as boas lembranças de Hilbert, reúnem a família e os amigos ao redor da mesa e, melhor de tudo, provocam sensações inesquecíveis aos convidados.",

    "description": "We want to be healthy. We want to be lean. And we want to lose that annoying fat around our bellies. Now we can! The Lose Your Belly Diet is built around a very clear, research-based concept: eating food that nourishes and protects the microbes in your gut paves the way for weight loss and a slimmer middle. Most importantly, having great gut health is linked to good health and wellbeing throughout your body. Scientists in this rapidly growing field are finding connections between the gut microbiome and a healthy immune system and gastrointestinal system, as well as autoimmune diseases (such as rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease), allergies and asthma – even cancer. And with every study that is published, they are convinced that a healthy gut leads to a healthy body. Indeed, when your gut is happy, your skin glows with health and you look and feel younger. The Lose Your Belly Diet includes meal plans, diet recommendations and recipes, giving readers everything they need to make dramatic changes in their GI health, their weight, their belly fat, and their overall health.",
