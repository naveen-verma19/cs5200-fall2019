    "description": "A breath-taking exploration of memory and what it means to be human, Recursion is the follow-up novel to the smash-hit thriller, Dark Matter, by Blake Crouch. What if someone could rewrite your entire life? 'My son has been erased.' Those are the last words the woman tells Barry Sutton, before she leaps from the Manhattan rooftop. Deeply unnerved, Barry begins to investigate her death, only to learn that this wasn't an isolated case. All across the country, people are waking up to lives different than the ones they fell asleep to. Are they suffering from False Memory Syndrome, a mysterious, new disease that afflicts people with vivid memories of a life they never lived? Or is something far more sinister behind the fracturing of reality all around him? Miles away, neuroscientist Helena Smith is developing a technology that allows us to preserve our most intense memories, and relive them. If she succeeds, anyone will be able to re-experience a first kiss, the birth of a child, the final moment with a dying parent. Barry's search for the truth leads him on an impossible, astonishing journey, as he discovers that Helena's work has yielded a terrifying gift - the ability not just to preserve memories, but to remake them . . . at the risk of destroying what it means to be human. PRAISE FOR RECURSION 'It's not often I plough through a book in two days. But Blake Crouch's action-packed, brilliantly unique Recursion had me up late and shirking responsibilities until I had devoured the last page. A fantastic read' Andy Weir, author of The Martian 'Recursion takes mind-twisting premises and embeds them in a deeply emotional story about time and loss and grief and most of all, the glory of the human heart' Gregg Hurwitz, author of the Orphan X series 'Blake Crouch has invented his own brand of page-turner--fearlessly genre-bending, consistently surprising, and determined to explode the boundaries of what a thriller can be' Karin Slaughter, author of the Grant County series 'Blake Crouch's fantastic, mind-blowing philosophical thriller' Yahoo News",

    "description": "'A dazzling hall-of-mirrors thriller: ferociously smart, furiously paced, and - best of all - honest-to-goodness surprising. All hail Wendy Walker.' AJ Finn Rosie Ferro and Laura Heart are sisters, but as different as it is possible to be. One is lucky in love and has a conventional family: a husband, and a small son. The other has a troubled past she is still struggling to break free from. When Laura disappears after going on a date with a stranger she met online, Rosie, her protector since they were young, springs into action to look for her. But as she slowly uncovers more about the situation, Rosie begins to fear that her sister might have been more of a danger than the man she went out with. Told in duel timelines - the night of and the night before, Wendy Walker's new novel is a riveting examination of family loyalty, obsession, and how just how far we will go for love. 'I raced through The Night Before, another page-turning cracker from Wendy Walker. You're in for a treat!' BA Paris",

But when Juan Ruiz proposes and promises to take her to New York City, she must say yes. It doesn't matter that he is twice her age, that there is no love between them. Their marriage is an opportunity for her entire close-knit family to eventually immigrate. So on New Year's Day, 1965, Ana leaves behind everything she knows and becomes Ana Ruiz, a wife confined to a cold six-floor walk-up in Washington Heights. Lonely and miserable, Ana hatches a reckless plan to escape. But at the bus terminal, she is stopped by César, Juan's free-spirited younger brother, who convinces her to stay. As the Dominican Republic slides into political turmoil, Juan returns to protect his family's assets, leaving César to take care of Ana. Suddenly, Ana is free to take English lessons at a local church, lie on the beach at Coney Island, dance with César at the Audubon Ballroom, and imagine the possibility of a different kind of life in America. When Juan returns, Ana must decide once again between her heart and her duty to her family. In bright, musical prose that reflects the energy of New York City, Dominicana is a vital portrait of the immigrant experience and the timeless coming-of-age story of a young woman finding her voice in the world.",

    "description": "From the New York Times bestselling author of The Night Circus, a timeless love story set in a secret underground world--a place of pirates, painters, lovers, liars, and ships that sail upon a starless sea. Zachary Ezra Rawlins is a graduate student in Vermont when he discovers a mysterious book hidden in the stacks. As he turns the pages, entranced by tales of lovelorn prisoners, key collectors, and nameless acolytes, he reads something strange: a story from his own childhood. Bewildered by this inexplicable book and desperate to make sense of how his own life came to be recorded, Zachary uncovers a series of clues--a bee, a key, and a sword--that lead him to a masquerade party in New York, to a secret club, and through a doorway to an ancient library hidden far below the surface of the earth. What Zachary finds in this curious place is more than just a buried home for books and their guardians--it is a place of lost cities and seas, lovers who pass notes under doors and across time, and of stories whispered by the dead. Zachary learns of those who have sacrificed much to protect this realm, relinquishing their sight and their tongues to preserve this archive, and also of those who are intent on its destruction. Together with Mirabel, a fierce, pink-haired protector of the place, and Dorian, a handsome, barefoot man with shifting alliances, Zachary travels the twisting tunnels, darkened stairwells, crowded ballrooms, and sweetly soaked shores of this magical world, discovering his purpose--in both the mysterious book and in his own life.",

In the dusty Appalachian hills of Troublesome Creek, nineteen and blue-skinned, Bluet has used up her last chance for “respectability” and a marriage bed. Instead, she joins the historical Pack Horse Library Project of Kentucky and becomes a librarian, riding up treacherous mountains on a mule to deliver books and other reading material to the poor hill communities of Eastern Kentucky. Along her dangerous route, Bluet confronts many who are distrustful of her blue skin. Not everyone is so keen on Bluet’s family or the Library Project, and the impoverished Kentuckians are quick to blame a Blue for any trouble in their small town. Inspired by the true and historical blue-skinned people of Kentucky and the dedicated Kentucky Pack Horse Library Project, The Book Woman of Troublesome Creek provides an authentic Appalachian voice to a story of hope, heartbreak and raw courage and shows one woman’s strength, despite it all, to push beyond the dark woods of Troublesome Creek.",

    "description": "Know your enemy – or be defeated. AD 2204 An alien shipwreck is discovered on a planet at the very limits of human expansion – so Security Director Feriton Kayne selects a team to investigate. The ship’s sinister cargo not only raises bewildering questions, but could also foreshadow humanity’s extinction. It will be up to the team to bring back answers, and the consequences of this voyage will change everything. Back on Earth, we can now make deserts bloom and extend lifespans indefinitely, so humanity seems invulnerable. We therefore welcomed the Olyix to Earth when they contacted us. They needed fuel for their pilgrimage across the galaxy – and in exchange they helped us advance our technology. But were the Olyix a blessing or a curse? THE FAR FUTURE Many lightyears from Earth, Dellian and his clan of genetically engineered soldiers are raised with one goal. They must confront and destroy their ancient adversary. The enemy caused mankind to flee across the galaxy and they hunt us still. If they aren’t stopped, we will be wiped out – and we’re running out of time. Salvation is the first title in a stunning science fiction trilogy, the Salvation Sequence, by Peter F. Hamilton",

Derry, Maine is just an ordinary town: familiar, well-ordered for the most part, a good place to live. It is a group of children who see - and feel - what makes Derry so horribly different. In the storm drains, in the sewers, IT lurks, taking on the shape of every nightmare, each one's deepest dread. Sometimes is appears as an evil clown named Pennywise and sometimes IT reaches up, seizing, tearing, killing . . . Time passes and the children grow up, move away and forget. Until they are called back, once more to confront IT as IT stirs and coils in the sullen depths of their memories, emerging again to make their past nightmares a terrible present reality.",

    "description": "Discover #1 New York Times-bestselling Patrick Rothfuss’ epic fantasy series, The Kingkiller Chronicle. “I just love the world of Patrick Rothfuss.” —Lin-Manuel Miranda • “He’s bloody good, this Rothfuss guy.” —George R. R. Martin • “Rothfuss has real talent.” —Terry Brooks OVER 1 MILLION COPIES SOLD! DAY ONE: THE NAME OF THE WIND My name is Kvothe. I have stolen princesses back from sleeping barrow kings. I burned down the town of Trebon. I have spent the night with Felurian and left with both my sanity and my life. I was expelled from the University at a younger age than most people are allowed in. I tread paths by moonlight that others fear to speak of during day. I have talked to Gods, loved women, and written songs that make the minstrels weep. You may have heard of me. So begins a tale unequaled in fantasy literature—the story of a hero told in his own voice. It is a tale of sorrow, a tale of survival, a tale of one man’s search for meaning in his universe, and how that search, and the indomitable will that drove it, gave birth to a legend. Praise for The Kingkiller Chronicle: “The best epic fantasy I read last year.... He’s bloody good, this Rothfuss guy.” —George R. R. Martin, New York Times-bestselling author of A Song of Ice and Fire “Rothfuss has real talent, and his tale of Kvothe is deep and intricate and wondrous.” —Terry Brooks, New York Times-bestselling author of Shannara \"It is a rare and great pleasure to find a fantasist writing...with true music in the words.\" —Ursula K. Le Guin, award-winning author of Earthsea \"The characters are real and the magic is true.” —Robin Hobb, New York Times-bestselling author of Assassin’s Apprentice \"Masterful.... There is a beauty to Pat's writing that defies description.\" —Brandon Sanderson, New York Times-bestselling author of Mistborn",

    "description": "Lou Bertignac a 13 ans, un QI de 160 et des questions plein la tête. Les yeux grand ouverts, elle observe les gens, collectionne les mots, se livre à des expériences domestiques et dévore les encyclopédies. Enfant unique d’une famille en déséquilibre, entre une mère brisée et un père champion de la bonne humeur feinte, dans l’obscurité d’un appartement dont les rideaux restent tirés, Lou invente des théories pour apprivoiser le monde. A la gare d’Austerlitz, elle rencontre No, une jeune fille SDF à peine plus âgée qu’elle. No, son visage fatigué, ses vêtements sales, son silence. No, privée d’amour, rebelle, sauvage. No dont l’errance et la solitude questionnent le monde. Des hommes et des femmes dorment dans la rue, font la queue pour un repas chaud, marchent pour ne pas mourir de froid. « Les choses sont ce qu’elles sont ». Voilà ce dont il faudrait se contenter pour expliquer la violence qui nous entoure. Ce qu’il faudrait admettre. Mais Lou voudrait que les choses soient autrement. Que la terre change de sens, que la réalité ressemble aux affiches du métro, que chacun trouve sa place. Alors elle décide de sauver No, de lui donner un toit, une famille, se lance dans une expérience de grande envergure menée contre le destin. Envers et contre tous. Roman d’apprentissage, No et moi est un rêve d’adolescence soumis à l’épreuve du réel. Un regard d’enfant précoce, naïf et lucide, posé sur la misère du monde. Un regard de petite fille grandie trop vite, sombre et fantaisiste.Un regard sur ce qui nous porte et ce qui nous manque, à jamais.",

    "description": "An international phenomenon, which has been declared a masterpiece everywhere it has been published. A searingly honest, addictive and controversial read. In this utterly remarkable novel Karl Ove Knausgaard writes with painful honesty about his childhood and teenage years, his infatuation with rock music, his relationship with his loving yet almost invisible mother and his distant and unpredictable father, and his bewilderment and grief on his father's death. When Karl Ove becomes a father himself, he must balance the demands of caring for a young family with his determination to write great literature. In A Death in the Family Knausgaard has created a universal story of the struggles, great and small, that we all face in our lives. A profoundly serious, gripping and hugely readable work written as if the author's very life were at stake.",

    "description": "Elísabet Benavent, también conocida como @BetaCoqueta, regresa con más fuerza que nunca para hablarnos de amor y de amistad a partes iguales, de melodías que fuimos, de momentos que seremos. Fuimos canciones es la primera parte de su bilogía «Canciones y recuerdos», que apunta directamente al corazón de sus lectoras, aquellas que se atrevieron con Valeria a ser ellas mismas. Macarena vive en Madrid y es asistente de una influencer de moda. Macarena disfruta la vida a sorbos e intenta ser feliz. Macarena tiene dos amigas: Adriana y Jimena. Macarena guarda un secreto que deletrea a escondidas. Ese secreto tiene tres letras: L-E-O. Macarena no sabe que Leo está en Madrid. Macarena teme, Macarena sueña, Macarena ama, Macarena vuela... Y en este juego del destino intenta aceptar que lo que fuimos no puede ser lo que seremos... ¿O quizás sí? Porque a veces lo que fuimos da sentido a lo que de verdad somos. Las lectoras comentan... «Una historia que tiene MAGIA con mayúsculas y no solo por su trama, sino por los sentimientos que desprenden cada uno de los protagonistas.» «De nuevo Elísabet lo vuelve a hacer. Personajes reales con reacciones naturales. Te traslada a ese café, a esa ventana, a ese invierno con bufanda compartida y olor a café.» «Lo ha vuelto a hacer. La historia te atrapa desde un principio y la haces tuya porque Elísabet no sabe escribir de otro modo que desde el sentimiento puro.» «Historia de amor maravillosa, Elísabet lo ha vuelto a conseguir.» En los blogs... «Ha sido una de mis mejores lecturas en lo que llevamos de año y estoy deseando leer la segunda parte.» Blog Los libros de Inés «La prosa de Elísabet Benavent es suave, profunda y muy poética, sin lugar a dudas leer a esta autora es todo un acierto porque sus historias son lo más adictivasy en cada una de ellas te deja un gran mensaje.» Blog Aprovecha la vida cada día «Una historia de amor muy intensa pero a la vez dolorosa, y es que aunque creía estar preparada para todo no me esperaba la intensidad de ese final que consiguió arrancarme el corazón.» Blog Tania entre libros «La historia de Macarena tiene todos los ingredientes para que la recuerdes: canciones, momentos, lugares, amistad, miradas, recuerdos, pasión, risas... ¡lo tiene todo! Y ahora solo queda esperar por la segunda parte, Seremos Recuerdos.» Blog Sara Lectora «Un título intenso, rebosante de sentimientos y con un toque cómico que te dejará con muchas ganas de leer su desenlace, Seremos Recuerdos.» Blog La estantería de Cho «Lo que no me esperaba era que esta historia fuera a convertirse en una de mis favoritas de la autora por esos personajes para recordar, esa pluma tan única y esa trama que te divierte y te hace sentir en la misma intensidad.» Blog La Atrapasueños «La prosa de la autora en esta historia me ha parecido maravillosa, muy ágil y perfilando a unas protagonistas que me han parecido verdaderamente reales.» Blog Historias de algodón «La historia transmite muy buenos principios y cada frase y escena era para enmarcarla. Personalmente, se me ha hecho un poco pesado, sobre todo al principio, pero eso no ha impedido que disfrutase de la historia.» Blog Libros Encantados «Fuimos canciones es la primera parte de su bilogía \"Canciones y recuerdos\", un libro con un final un tanto amargo pero una historia que consigues disfrutar. Un libro con el que no dejas de reír, pero, en algunas ocasiones, también consigues llorar.» Blog Laura Ever",

    "description": "Winner of the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction 2014 Aged thirteen, Theo Decker, son of a devoted mother and a reckless, largely absent father, survives an accident that otherwise tears his life apart. Alone and rudderless in New York, he is taken in by the family of a wealthy friend. He is tormented by an unbearable longing for his mother, and down the years clings to the thing that most reminds him of her: a small, strangely captivating painting that ultimately draws him into the criminal underworld. As he grows up, Theo learns to glide between the drawing rooms of the rich and the dusty antiques store where he works. He is alienated and in love - and his talisman, the painting, places him at the centre of a narrowing, ever more dangerous circle. The Goldfinch is a haunted odyssey through present-day America and a drama of enthralling power. Combining unforgettably vivid characters and thrilling suspense, it is a beautiful, addictive triumph - a sweeping story of loss and obsession, of survival and self-invention, of the deepest mysteries of love, identity and fate.",

A fun and flirty novel from New York Times bestseller Jasmine Guillory, author of The Wedding Date, one of Cosmopolitan's 33 Books to Get Excited About in 2018. For fans of Jo Watson, Sarah Morgan and Holly Martin, about the perils of public proposals and the beauty of an unexpected second chance. When freelance writer Nikole Paterson goes to a Dodgers game in LA with her actor boyfriend, the last thing she expects is a scoreboard proposal. Saying no isn't difficult - they've only been dating for five months, and he can't even spell her name correctly. The hard part is having to face a stadium full of disappointed fans... At the game with his sister, Carlos Ibarra comes to Nik's rescue and rushes her away from a camera crew. He's even there for her when the video goes viral and Nik's social media goes crazy. Believing that neither of them are looking for anything serious, Nik embarks on an epic rebound with the handsome doctor, filled with food, fun, and fantastic sex. But when their glorified hookups start breaking the rules, will they be brave enough to admit what they're really feeling?

    "description": "A cold case involving a missing private investigator threatens to unearth skeletons from Rebus's past in this \"must-read\" mystery (Tana French). Former Detective John Rebus' retirement is disrupted once again when skeletal remains are identified as a private investigator who went missing over a decade earlier. The remains, found in a rusted car in the East Lothian woods, not far from Edinburgh, quickly turn into a cold case murder investigation. Rebus' old friend, Siobhan Clarke is assigned to the case, but neither of them could have predicted what buried secrets the investigation will uncover. Rebus remembers the original case -- a shady land deal -- all too well. After the investigation stalled, the family of the missing man complained that there was a police cover-up. As Clarke and her team investigate the cold case murder, she soon learns a different side of her mentor, a side he would prefer to keep in the past. A gripping story of corruption and consequences, this new novel demonstrates that Rankin and Rebus are still at the top of their game.",

In North Devon, where the rivers Taw and Torridge converge and run into the sea, Detective Matthew Venn stands outside the church as his father's funeral takes place. The day Matthew turned his back on the strict evangelical community in which he grew up, he lost his family too. Now he's back, not just to mourn his father at a distance, but to take charge of his first major case in the Two Rivers region; a complex place not quite as idyllic as tourists suppose. A body has been found on the beach near to Matthew's new home: a man with the tattoo of an albatross on his neck, stabbed to death. Finding the killer is Venn’s only focus, and his team’s investigation will take him straight back into the community he left behind, and the deadly secrets that lurk there.",

Ulf Varg works in Malmo's Department of Sensitive Crimes. Like all Scandinavian detectives he has his issues. In his case these include his unresolved feelings for his colleague, Anna; his impatience over the seeming incompetence of his irritating colleague Blomquist; and his concerns for the health of his hearing-impaired dog, Marten, the only dog in Sweden (and possibly all Scandinavia) who is able to lip-read (in Swedish). Along with his colleagues, Ulf is called upon to investigate a bizarre attack on a market trader, the disappearance of a handsome man who may or may not exist, and the affairs of a variety of young female students whose relationships with one another leave a great deal to be desired. Ulf and his team come to realise that the world is a puzzling place, lycanthropy (were-wolfism) exists and fish might have something to teach us. There is so much to learn if you are a Swedish detective, and in the first book in this new quasi-Scandinavian series, Ulf Varg embarks on these lessons with spirit and good humour.",

Joe Pike didn't expect to rescue a woman that day. He went to the bank same as anyone goes to the bank, and returned to his Jeep. So when Isabel Roland, the lonely young teller who helped him, steps out of the bank on her way to lunch, Joe is on hand when two men abduct her. Joe chases them down, and the two men are arrested. But instead of putting the drama to bed, the arrests are only the beginning of the trouble for Joe and Izzy. After posting bail, the two abductors are murdered and Izzy disappears. Pike calls on his friend, Elvis Cole, to help learn the truth. What Elvis uncovers is a twisted family story that involves corporate whistleblowing, huge amounts of cash, the Witness Relocation Program, and a long line of lies. But what of all that did Izzy know? Is she a perpetrator or a victim? And how far will Joe go to find out?",

    "description": "· · · SHORTLISTED FOR THE MAN BOOKER PRIZE 2018 · · · ‘Autumn makes me think of leaves, which makes me think of trees, which makes me think of The Overstory, the best novel ever written about trees, and really, just one of the best novels, period.’ - Ann Patchett 'It's a masterpiece.' - Tim Winton 'It’s not possible for Powers to write an uninteresting book.' - Margaret Atwood A monumental novel about trees and people by one of our most 'prodigiously talented' (The New York Times Book Review) novelists. The Overstory unfolds in concentric rings of interlocking fables that range from antebellum New York to the late twentieth-century Timber Wars of the Pacific Northwest and beyond: An Air Force loadmaster in the Vietnam War is shot out of the sky, then saved by falling into a banyan. An artist inherits a hundred years of photographic portraits, all of the same doomed American chestnut. A hard-partying undergraduate in the late 1980s electrocutes herself, dies and is sent back into life by creatures of air and light. A hearing- and speech-impaired scientist discovers that trees are communicating with one another. These four, and five other strangers – each summoned in different ways by trees – are brought together in a last and violent stand to save the continent’s few remaining acres of virgin forest. There is a world alongside ours – vast, slow, interconnected, resourceful, magnificently inventive and almost invisible to us. This is the story of a handful of people who learn how to see that world and who are drawn up into its unfolding catastrophe.",

Hope Anderson is at a crossroads. At thirty-six, she's been dating her boyfriend, an orthopedic surgeon, for six years. With no wedding plans in sight, and her father recently diagnosed with ALS, she decides to use a week at her family's cottage in Sunset Beach, North Carolina, to ready the house for sale and mull over some difficult decisions about her future. Tru Walls has never visited North Carolina but is summoned to Sunset Beach by a letter from a man claiming to be his father. A safari guide, born and raised in Zimbabwe, Tru hopes to unravel some of the mysteries surrounding his mother's early life and recapture memories lost with her death. When the two strangers cross paths, their connection is as electric as it is unfathomable . . . but in the immersive days that follow, their feelings for each other will give way to choices that pit family duty against personal happiness in devastating ways. Illuminating life's heartbreaking regrets and enduring hope, EVERY BREATH explores the many facets of love that lay claim to our deepest loyalties--while asking the question, How long can a dream survive?",

    "description": "'The Need is a profound meditation on the nature of reality, a fearless examination of parenthood, and also somehow a thriller. This is an extraordinary and dazzlingly original work from one of our most gifted and interesting writers' Emily St. John Mandel She crouched in front of the mirror in the dark, clinging to them. The baby in her right arm, the child in her left. There were footsteps in the other room... Molly is exhausted, anxious, losing her grip on reality. Her husband is away and she is running between her children and her job, where things are unravelling. She’s a paleobotanist, working at a fossil quarry, and has recently unearthed artefacts that defy understanding; the coke bottle with the lettering that leans the wrong way, an alternate version of the Bible. Where do these things come from? At home, as dusk falls, she gets jumpy. Are those footsteps out in the hall? What was that noise? She holds her two small children close to her, and tries to pull herself together. But her worlds of work and home are about to collide. She discovers that the stranger in her sitting room knows everything about her life and, as their identity becomes chillingly clear, this intruder makes a demand of Molly that upends everything, forcing her to reckon with her most unspeakable fears. The Need is a gripping, unsettling and stunningly original story that probes deep truths about motherhood, and explores grief, loss and how we treat others. It's a compulsive, reality-warping novel that makes us rethink our world, and question how far we would go to protect the ones we love. 'Helen Phillips is one of the most exciting young writers working today, and I envy those who get to discover her work here for the first time' Jenny Offill",

The worst of the plague is now past, and Manhattan is slowly being resettled. Armed forces have successfully reclaimed the island south of Canal Street - aka 'Zone One' and teams of civilian volunteers are clearing out the remaining infected 'stragglers'. Mark Spitz is a member of one of these taskforces and over three surreal days he undertakes the mundane mission of malfunctioning zombie removal, the rigours of Post-Apocalyptic Stress Disorder, and attempting to come to terms with a fallen world.

    "description": "David Foster Wallace's final and most ambitious undertaking - an audacious and hilarious look into the abyss of ordinary life. The agents at the IRS Regional Examination Centre in Peoria, IL, appear ordinary enough to newly arrived trainee David Foster Wallace. But as he immerses himself in a routine so tedious and repetitive that new employees receive boredom-survival training, he learns of the extraordinary variety of personalities drawn to this strange calling. And he has arrived at a moment when forces within the IRS are plotting to eliminate even what little humanity and dignity the work still has. The Pale King remained unfinished at the time of David Foster Wallace's death, but it is a deeply intriguing and satisfying novel, hilarious and fearless and as original as anything Wallace ever undertook.",

    "description": "An Anchor Paperback Original An intelligent, sophisticated cross-section of Irish short fiction, ideal for casual readers and classrooms alike, that showcases where Irish writers are now, as well as where they are headed. The contemporary Irish short story, perhaps even more than the novel, provides vital critical clues and guideposts for anyone interested in twentieth-century Irish writing--the Irish, after all, have always been a nation of storytellers, and the current practioners of this ancient tradition are in the process of exploding and rediefining the form. The Anchor Book of New Irish Writing features a group of writers whose influence is already strongly felt in Irish literature, and who deserve to be better known in American, among them Aidan Matthews and Anne Enright. The stories themselves are beautifully written, well-chosen by the editors, and presented in such a way as to guide readers through the fascinating dramatic, structural, and technical themes explored by contemporary Irish stories. The result is a rich sampling of these writers including the work of more familiar ones-from Elizabetth Bowen to Neil Jordan-a collection that promises to introduce the new classics of Irish literature to a wider audience. List of contributors: Elizabeth Bowen John Banville Desmond Hogan Bernard McLaverty Cherry Smyth Clare Boylan Rita Kelly Maeve Binchy Anne Devlin Evelyn Conlon Emma Donoghue Aiden Matthews Anne Enright Patrick McCabe Rohan Sheenan Michael O'Loughlin Eamonn Sweeney Marcy Dorcey Ellis Ní Dhuibhne Joseph O'Connor Colum McCann Neil Jordan From the Trade Paperback edition.",

If possessing charm, wit, good looks and success doesn't guarantee finding the perfect man, what does? The second book in a two-part series, The Forever Game brings back three best friends from the nation's capital as they drift through a sea of live. Each is searching for \"the one\" while running from all the broken hearts and drama they leave in their wake. Taika - beautiful, intelligent, and confident, has finally found her perfect man - until issues in the bedroom threaten to strain the relationship beyond repair. Vince is a hopeless romantic artist who sees the potential in every woman he dates, until he is painfully forced to admit failure with each one. And Trey saunters from one lustful encounter to another, casually going in and out of passing dalliances. But is his cavalier attitude just a way to escape the pain of Layla, the ex love-of-his-life, who ruined his heart, for good? Then two mysterious women enter their lives, and suddenly the worlds of Trey, Vince and Taika collide. They must choose where their loyalties lie, and how much they are willing to give up in order to find lasting love.",
