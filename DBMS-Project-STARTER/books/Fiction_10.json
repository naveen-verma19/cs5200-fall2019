    "description": "We all live hectic lives and spend so much of our time dealing with our own problems while searching for our own pursuit of happiness scattered within the daily grind. We live our lives hoping our government will act in our best interest. Roy Simpson was one of these people, no different than the rest of us. Until, one night he disappeared and when he returned something about him had changed. Initially, he accepted this change as a gift and looked for ways to profit from it. Roy soon realized money was not a motivating factor for him. He just wanted to help. He wanted make our country a better place, so he decided to contact Congress and plead his case knowing his fellow Americans at the capitol would only rally his cause. Finding only deaf ears and hands open only for contributions. Roy embarks on quest to be the first average citizen to be elected President of the United States and change the government within. As he traveled the country he would ask Where Do We Go From Here? Do we continue electing people from the same two political parties? The very people that have offered us nothing but double talk and detailed descriptions of our problems and then offer no solutions. It isn't long before the night he disappeared and its relevance crashes down on Roy. Is he really the person he thinks he is? Is he just a pawn in a master plan? Will he have the courage to resist taking the path with the least resistance? Can he find the answer to the question and what was behind his disappearance?",

City of Bones is a Shadowhunters novel. When Clary Fray heads out to the Pandemonium Club in New York City, she hardly expects to witness a murder—much less a murder committed by three people covered with strange tattoos and brandishing bizarre weapons. And she’s more than a little startled when the body disappears into thin air. Soon Clary is introduced to the world of the Shadowhunters, a secret cadre of warriors dedicated to driving demons out of our world and back to their own. And Clary is introduced with a vengeance, when her mother disappears and Clary herself is almost killed by a grotesque monster. How could a mere human survive such an attack and kill a demon? The Shadowhunters would like to know…",

    "description": "When love and desperation collide, the pressure is on. She rescues someone she loves only to lose another... Being the daughter to the Devil has its draw backs, just ask seventeen-year-old Desdemona Starr, aka Dessi, who attends the Morning Star Institute, a private school where teenage Hellions, paranormals like Dessi, can learn and practice their Hell-given crafts. There Dessi's life takes a dramatic turn towards chaos when she learns she's part of a prophecy foretelling she will one day tip the scale of Light or Dark, ultimately creating a war between Heaven and Hell. Pulled in one direction by an intense desire for her Hellhound boyfriend, Ace, and in another by her profound connection to the prophecy set on making her life a living Hell, pun intended, Dessi endures loss and suffers discord to reach a critical point in her life; the impossible question of who to save first. While she is devising a plan to free her brother from his imprisonment, she is too distracted by wailing vindictive banshees, evil spirits set on torturing her, and moon rituals going awry, to notice the boy she loves slowly slipping away from her. Will Dessi lose more than she bargained for this time? Heartache is inevitable. And this time when all of the monsters that go bump in the night come out to play, it's eat or be eaten. Life in Hell just got hotter for this dark princess, and only a certain pesky Angel can save her now.",

Her car had run into a ditch during the storm and it look like she would need to take shelter inside. But she was not alone and her host was a little upset at this unwelcome invasion. By morning, Myra's investigation of the three-story manor and the meeting of the ghost reveal a hundred year old murder. What more, the uncanny resemblance between Myra and the Ghost Mariah is more than coincidental. Why are the spirits trapped in this house? And what of the Dark Spirit that holds them there and feed off their terror? Can the psychic, Adrian, whom Myra had employed for help, release Mariah and the other spirits without harming Myra who has a paranormal connection with this house, its resident and its past? Venture with him into the very bowels of the Earth as Adrian attempts a rescue of Myra's astral body that has been taken by the Dark Spirit into Hades itself. But there is a surprise ending, for just when you think it is the end, it is actually the beginning of an adventure to end the Curse. But it can only be removed at the time it was first place on the ancestor of the Worthington family, yes they must travel back into time.",

Reilly of New Orleans, noble crusader against a world of dunces. The ordinary folk of New Orleans seem to think he is unhinged. Ignatius ignores them, heaving his vast bulk through the city's fleshpots in a noble crusade against vice, modernity and ignorance. But his momma has a nasty surprise in store for him: Ignatius must get a job. Undaunted, he uses his new-found employment to further his mission - and now he has a pirate costume and a hot-dog cart to do it with... Never published during his lifetime, John Kennedy Toole's hilarious satire, A Confederacy of Dunces is a Don Quixote for the modern age, and this Penguin Modern Classics edition includes a foreword by Walker Percy.

Die Erstausstrahlung der beiden Staffeln erfolgte in Deutschland 2008 bei Das Erste und 2013/2014 beim ZDF. Der Privatdetektiv Varg Veum erhält von einer bekannten Anwältin den Auftrag, nach ihrer verschollenen Schwester und deren Mann zu suchen. Rasch findet Veum heraus, dass der Mann bei einer Firma angestellt war, die Giftmüll in die Dritte Welt exportiert und afrikanische Flüchtlinge nach Norwegen schmuggelt. Mit Unterstützung einer Starreporterin ist der Fall schnell an die Öffentlichkeit gebracht, doch das Rätsel der Verschwundenen bleibt lange ungelöst ...

Cool and cynical, he's weary of life's fickle games and wants a prim and proper wife he can ignore while indulging his sensual appetites. Lady Melisande Carstairs is nothing less than a tornado storming into Benedick's measured life. Possessed of boundless energy and the soul of a reformer, Melisande always conquers, whether it's saving the souls of soiled doves or seducing the man she's inconveniently fallen for. When she informs Benedick that his brother's newly revived Heavenly Host has graduated from simple carnal debauchery to sadistic violence, he's compelled to investigate, undercover. Under those covers, however, is Melisande herself, playing a dangerous game in the name of justice. And the Heavenly Host has just seen her hand, and more…",

    "description": "Published before the famous stand-off, Crashed called out the Bundy family as leaders against government overreach. Copyrighted in 2013, Crashed predicted moves by Russia to reclaim former Soviet territories in Eastern Europe. Crashed predicted an unexpected rise in the value of the Dollar. Will it be right again? Will the market start collapsing by late 2015/early 2016? \"We're not pickin' the fight. The government already did that. We'd just be finally fightin' back for a change.\" - Phillip Brown In his first novel, CRASHED: The Death Of The Dollar, William Cooper explores what our government's reaction to a U.S. currency collapse would be. But he does so quite differently from most similarly themed novels. Crashed follows a reclusive mountain rancher on a journey through coming out of his shell, finding love and a family, and inadvertently becoming a part of the local community following a gesture of kindness. All set against the backdrop of the dollar losing it's value, and the government nationalizing all supply chains in an effort to keep order. This is a fast-paced read that has reviewers calling for a sequel. Words like \"thought provoking, captivating,\" and \"gripping\" are found throughout, and numerous readers express concern that it seems eerily like future history.",

    "description": "Even Love Can Hurt You is a romantic fiction story based on impersonalized emotional feelings …\"that burned, and hurt, and stole away all pride in the ability to love and to cherish that love … with wishes of a fantastic rejuvenation, blemishing from a heart so deeply wounded to blame …\". The story reflects personal and impersonal real life experiences. All illustrations have been dramatized to provide a humorous background of exciting entertainment that would leave each and every reader wondering how a new kid on the block could be so amazingly thrilling. The piece explores the wonders of love with respect to emotional syndromes from particular reflexes on romantic and other socially hurtful feelings. Most facts have been intentionally distorted, and in most cases unconditionally dramatized. All names of characters have been made up, with little or no prejudice used to project the characterizations and roles. The story attempts to psychologically analyze real life situations in which people, in one way or the other, get hurt because they claim somehow to be in love. It emphasizes the fact that even love could be hurtful depending on the circumstances underlying the actions of the parties concerned. Sally, the story's protagonist feels extremely hurt when she comes home from work one day only to discover that her husband had walked out on her. She expressed her hurt in a poem in which she describes how her eyes were filled with tears when she stared at their \"legitimate bond\" Her ignorance drove her to seclude herself from all glorious fantasies an isolation that caused her much emotional pain that burned, and hurt, and stole away all pride in her ability to love and to cherish that love. In despair of her hurtful feelings, Sally expresses a desire for their love to stay the way it was, or should have been; and declares that his victory over her will ever be wrong. On his part, Rick breaks his silence in a poem to his friend saying, \"silence\" was a weapon that provided \"pouvoir\" (power) to battle the unforeseen mistakes\". Most other characters in the book are portrayed either in hurt, or hurting someone in pretext of love. Rita's situation is notable for the dramatic and manipulative nature in which her friends sabotaged her love affair claiming to be protective of her. She fights real hard to overcome the melancholy, but encounters tough emotional times when her lover stubbornly continues to exude a desire to come back giving a damn to every circumstance or consequence that could stand in his way. Even Love Can Hurt You explores most psychological attributes of love in a humorous and pragmatic manner. The story is thrillingly romantic, and analyses the wonders of love amazingly with emphasis on hurtful occasions. The piece is quite entertaining and multi-cultural, with no specific cultural affiliation; and reflects a good variety of societies put together with an intention to broaden excitement in all readers. Hurtful feelings from political, social, and economic perspectives such as those demonstrated at a town-meeting in Mayville are also humored, as",

    "description": "The cold-blooded murder of Kevin Rees, Auxiliary Nurse at the private Howell Clinic for stroke victims, is greeted with apparent sorrow by all who knew him - well, nearly all. 'A born nurse' is the summation of his professional qualities by colleagues and patients alike. But is Dr. Edwin Howell, maverick neuro-psychiatrist, and co-owner of the clinic set in the shadow of Llandaff's Anglican Cathedral, just saving face when he anxiously divines the crime was the work of a burglar? Only when DCI Merlin Parry rejects such a facile solution and digs deeper into Rees's background do the unsavoury aspects of the young man's life surface. The police investigation reveals details of Rees's time not only at the clinic, but also in the army, at St. Mark's Hospital in London, and more especially with the London Ambulance Service. Was Denis Ingram, the rich and successful industrialist, now a patient at the Howell Clinic, somehow indebted to Rees? And why is Ingram's possibly unfaithful wife intent on deceiving the police about what she knows of Rees - something she has in common with the clinic's matron, as well as the wife of the head gardener, and the paramedic Stacey Fowler? The action moves from Cardiff to a manor house near Chepstow, to London's Festival Hall, and to the Roman Catholic Cathedral in Bristol, along the way directly involving Perdita Jones, Parry's fiance, Lucy, the eldest daughter of DS Gomer Lloyd and a string of crafted characters.",

    "description": "A romance novel by an Amish writer, based on true experiences! It isn't that Lizzie doesn't want to stay Amish. It's just that there is so much to figure out. Like why can't she let her hair a little looser on top? And why can't she wear shoes with a little bit more of a heel? And will she ever really just know for a fact who she is going to marry like her next-older sister, Emma, does? And how does it happen that her just-younger sister, Mandy, is going on a date before Lizzie ever has a real one? So does it matter at all if she eats one more whoopie pie? Amos seems to like her a lot when she pounds out the ping-pong games. He even asks her to be his partner in doubles. But then he asks Ruthie if he can take her home! It has been this way Lizzie's whole life. She has too hot a temper. She hates housework and dislikes babies. She loves driving fast horses but is petrified of going away from home for a week to work as a maud (maid). Now that Lizzie is running around, will she scare off the Amish boys with her hi-jinks manners? She has certainly attracted the attention of the egg-truck driver. A scary thrill runs through her every time the worldly man comes to pick up an order, each time extending his stay a little longer. How long will she keep this a secret from Emma—and from Mamm and Datt? What will become of Lizzie? Is she too spirited, too innocent, and almost too uninhibited for a young Amish woman? Skyhorse Publishing, as well as our Arcade, Yucca, and Good Books imprints, are proud to publish a broad range of books for readers interested in fiction—novels, novellas, political and medical thrillers, comedy, satire, historical fiction, romance, erotic and love stories, mystery, classic literature, folklore and mythology, literary classics including Shakespeare, Dumas, Wilde, Cather, and much more. While not every title we publish becomes a New York Times bestseller or a national bestseller, we are committed to books on subjects that are sometimes overlooked and to authors whose work might not otherwise find a home.",

The series of events that happen after she is rescued leave little to the imagination. She is now the product of her captor, not able to function in any other way but to satisfy the willing male. The author also shows how one woman can enable another to break free of her own inhibitions and become the woman that she was meant to be. It is amazing how what we think can inhibit how we act and how we think of others. Learn about raw sexual need and learn how it is satiated.",

He stays at the edge of an outcast community inhabited by eccentrics, criminals and the poverty-stricken. Rising above the physical and human squalor around him, his detachment and wry humour enable him to survive dereliction and destitution with dignity. ‘Suttree contains a humour that is Faulknerian in its gentle wryness, and a freakish imaginative flair reminiscent of Flannery O’Connor’ Times Literary Supplement ‘Suttree marks McCarthy’s closest approach to autobiography and is probably the funniest and most unbearably sad of his books’ Stanley Booth",

    "description": "Lu Xun (Lu Hsun) is arguably the greatest writer of modern China, and is considered by many to be the founder of modern Chinese literature. Lu Xun's stories both indict outdated Chinese traditions and embrace China's cultural richness and individuality. This volume presents brand-new translations by Julia Lovell of all of Lu Xun's stories, including 'The Real Story of Ah-Q', 'Diary of a Madman', 'A Comedy of Ducks', 'The Divorce' and 'A Public Example', among others. With an afterword by Yiyun Li.",

    "description": "Toby and his brother team up to protect a magician from disappearing for good. In the six years since he lost his job working security at the Warner Brothers' lot, private investigator Toby Peters has taken cases from oddballs ranging from Peter Lorre to W. C. Fields. But none of them had the stage presence of Harry Blackstone, the greatest magician in the world. When an anonymous rival demands the illusionist reveal his secrets on stage or suffer the consequences, Blackstone hires Toby and his brother, ex-cop Phil, to run security at the show. What starts as a simple protection job turns dicey when Toby finds himself onstage, with a possibly unsafe magic saw about to slice through his midsection. Bodies pile up around the act, and the two detectives begin to think that the killer isn't a jealous member of the Los Angeles Friends of Magic, but rather the great magician himself. About the Author. Stuart M. Kaminsky (1934-2009) was one of the most prolific crime fiction authors of the last four decades. Born in Chicago, he spent his youth immersed in pulp fiction and classic cinema - two forms of popular entertainment which he would make his life's work. After college and a stint in the army, Kaminsky wrote film criticism and biographies of the great actors and directors of Hollywood's Golden Age. In 1977, when a planned biography of Charlton Heston fell through, Kaminsky wrote Bullet for a Star, his first Toby Peters novel, beginning a fiction career that would last the rest of his life. Kaminsky penned twenty-four novels starring the detective, whom he described as \"the anti-Philip Marlowe.\" In 1981's Death of a Dissident, Kaminsky debuted Moscow police detective Porfiry Rostnikov, whose stories were praised for their accurate depiction of Soviet life. His other two series starred Abe Lieberman, a hardened Chicago cop, and Lew Fonseca, a process server. In all, Kaminsky wrote more than sixty novels. He died in St. Louis in 2009. Review quote. \"Kaminsky stands out as a subtle historian, unobtrusively but entertainingly weaving into the story itself what people were wearing, eating, driving, and listening to on the radio. A page-turning romp.\" - Booklist. \"If you like your mysteries Sam Spade tough, with tongue-in-cheek and a touch of the theatrical, then the Toby Peters series is just your ticket.\" - Houston Chronicle. \"For anyone with a taste for old Hollywood B-movie mysteries, Edgar winner Kaminsky offers plenty of nostalgic fun . . . The tone is light, the pace brisk, the tongue firmly in cheek.\" - Publishers Weekly. \"Marvelously entertaining.\" - Newsday. \"Makes the totally wacky possible . . . Peters [is] an unblemished delight.\" - Washington Post. \"The Ed McBain of Mother Russia.\" - Kirkus Reviews.",
