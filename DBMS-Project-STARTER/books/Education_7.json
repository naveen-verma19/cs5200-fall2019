    "description": "By focusing on material most relevant to the Introductory Psychology course while maintaining the narrative flow, authors Ellen Pastorino and Susann Doyle-Portillo invite students to see the big picture of psychology as opposed to a collection of fragmented ideas. With an unparalleled integration of diversity, applications, and critical thinking, WHAT IS PSYCHOLOGY? captures and holds students' interest using The Big Picture, a real life story of a person whose experience illustrates the concepts of the chapter. Upon entering this course, today's students ask Why should Psychology matter to me? Drawing from their own research and first-hand work in classrooms on assessment, inclusion, and reaching under-prepared students, Pastorino and Doyle-Portillo answer this question using practical everyday examples focused on the student (e.g., asking students to design a research study based on the hypothesis that listening to rock and roll facilitates studying).

    "description": "\"The landscape for education has been rapidly changing in the last years: demographic changes affecting the makeup of families, multiple school options available to children, wealth disparities, the global economy demanding new skills from workers, and continued breakthroughs in technology are some of the factors impacting education. Given these changes, how can schools continue to prepare students for the future? In a world where information is readily available online, how can schools continue to be relevant? The emergence of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has exacerbated the need to have these conversations. Its impact on education and the multiple possibilities that it offers are putting pressure on educational leaders to reformulate the school curriculum and the channels to deliver it. The book \"Artificial Intelligence in Education, Promises and Implications for Teaching and Learning\" by the Center for Curriculum Redesign immerses the reader in a discussion on what to teach students in the era of AI and examines how AI is already demanding much needed updates to the school curriculum, including modernizing its content, focusing on core concepts, and embedding interdisciplinary themes and competencies with the end goal of making learning more enjoyable and useful in students' lives. The second part of the book dives into the history of AI in education, its techniques and applications -including the way AI can help teachers be more effective, and finishes on a reflection about the social aspects of AI. This book is a must-read for educators and policy-makers who want to prepare schools to face the uncertainties of the future and keep them relevant.\" --Amada Torres, VP, Studies, Insights, and Research, National Association of Independent School (NAIS) \"The rapid advances in technology in recent decades have already brought about substantial changes in education, opening up new opportunities to teach and learn anywhere anytime and providing new tools and methods to improve learning outcomes and support innovative teaching and learning.Research into artificial intelligence and machine learning in education goes back to the late 1970s. Artificial intelligence methods were generally employed in two ways: to design and facilitate interactive learning environments that would support learning by doing, and to design and implement tutoring systems by adapting instructions with respect to the students' knowledge state.But this is just the beginning. As Artificial Intelligence in Education shows, AI is increasingly used in education and learning contexts. The collision of three areas - data, computation and education - is set to have far-reaching consequences, raising fundamental questions about the nature of education: what is taught and how it is taught. Artificial Intelligence in Education is an important, if at times disturbing, contribution to the debate on AI and provides a detailed analysis on how it may affect the way teachers and students engage in education. The book describes how artificial intelligence may impact on curriculum design, on the individualisation of learning, and on assessment, offering some tantalising glimpses into the future (the end of exams, your very own lifelong learning companion) while not falling victim to tech-hype. The enormous ethical, technical and pedagogical challenges ahead are spelt out, and there is a real risk that the rapid advances in artificial intelligence products and services will outstrip education systems' capacity to understand, manage and integrate them appropriately. As the book concludes: \"We can either leave it to others (the computer scientists, AI engineers and big tech companies) to decide how artificial intelligence in education unfolds, or we can engage in productive dialogue.\"I commend this book to anyone concerned with the future of education in a digital world.\" --Marc Durando, Executive Director, European Schoolnet",

Minh-ha. \"At one level or another, all the work in the collection seeks to find ways to understand and articulate our multiple identities and senses of place….Making Face/Making Soul is an exciting collection of dynamic, important writings that all women of color and white feminists will learn from, enjoy, and return to again and again and again.\"—Sojourner \"...the pieces are stunning in what they risk and reveal...\"—The San Francisco Chronicle",

    "description": "The Art of Teaching Writing, New Edition, has major new chapters on assessment, thematic studies, writing throughout the day, reading/writing relationships, publication, curriculum development, nonfiction writing and home/school connections. Annotation. When Lucy Calkins wrote the first edition of The Art of Teaching Writing, the writing workshop was a fledgling idea, piloted by a few brave innovators. Now, as she brings us this new edition, the writing workshop is at the foundation of language arts education throughout the English-speaking world. This new edition, then, could easily have been a restatement, in grander, more confident tones, of the original classic. Instead, it is an almost entirely new book. Clearly, during the time in which Calkins' original ideas have spread like wildlife, her focus has not been on articulating and defending those ideas, but on developing and rethinking them. Respecting and responding to the questions that have arisen as thousands of teachers establish writing workshops in their classrooms, and drawing upon the latest knowledge in the field and her own intimate understanding of classroom life, Calkins has re-thought every line and every facet of her original text. In this new edition, Lucy has major new chapters on assessment, thematic studies, writing throughout the day, reading-writing relationships, publication, curriculum development, non-fiction writing and home/school connections.",

    "description": "Crimes of the Educators reveals how the architects of America's public school disaster implemented a plan to socialize the United States by knowingly and willingly dumbing down the population, a mission closer to success than ever as the Obama administration works relentlessly to nationalize K-12 schooling with Common Core. The whole-word method of teaching children to read – introduced by John Dewey and colleagues in the early 20th century and which permeates Common Core - is a significant cause of dyslexia among students. Public education's war against religion, the \"great American math disaster,\" promotion of death education, and the government's plan to lower standards for all so \"no one is left behind\" is destroying the logic, reasoning, and overall educational prowess of America's next generation. American author and veteran educator Samuel Blumenfeld and journalist Alex Newman have taken on the public education establishment as never before and exposed it for the de facto criminal enterprise it is.",

Intended for preservice and in-service teachers and educators, this book looks at how personal, social, political, cultural, and educational factors affect the success or failure of students in today's classroom. Expanding upon the popular case-study approach, the fifth edition also examines the lives of 19 real students who are affected by multicultural education, or a lack of it. Topics include racial, linguistic, religious, cultural, and sexual diversity. Social justice is firmly embedded in this view of multicultural education, and teachers are encouraged to work for social change in their classrooms, schools, and communities.",

    "description": "Inferring, questioning, determining importance. It's not easy to explain these abstract reading strategies to elementary readers, yet knowing how they work and how to use them is an important first step to connecting with texts. Fortunately Tanny McGregor has developed visual, tangible, everyday lessons that make abstract thinking concrete and that can help every child in your classroom make more effective use of reading comprehension strategies. Comprehension Connections is a guide to developing children's ability to fully understand texts by making the comprehension process achievable, accessible, and incremental. McGregor's approach sequences stages of learning for each strategy that take students from a fun object lesson to a nuanced and lasting understanding. Her lessons build bridges between the concrete and the abstract by incorporating writing, discussion, song, art, and movement into a web of creative connections that reinforce each strategy on a variety of levels. All the while Comprehension Connections offers an inside look at the dynamic of McGregor's teaching, showing you how her ideas look in action, and including the language she uses and that she encourages her students to use as they build their facility with: schema inferring questioning determining importance visualizing synthesizing. Many students struggle to understand what it is they are supposed to do as they learn to read strategically. Help them make connections to the ideas behind reading and watch as your readers go deeper into texts than ever before.

    ],
    "publishedDate": "2018-09-17",
    "description": "Let's start with two truths about our era that are so inescapable as to have become clichés: We are surrounded by more readily available information than ever before. And a huge percentage of it is inaccurate. Some of the bad info is well-meaning but ignorant. Some of it is deliberately deceptive. All of it is pernicious. With the internet always at our fingertips, what's a teacher of history to do? Sam Wineburg has answers, beginning with this: We definitely can't stick to the same old read-the-chapter-answer-the-questions-at-the-back snoozefest we've subjected students to for decades. If we want to educate citizens who can sift through the mass of information around them and separate fact from fake, we have to explicitly work to give them the necessary critical thinking tools. Historical thinking, Wineburg shows us in Why Learn History (When It's Already on Your Phone), has nothing to do with test prep-style ability to memorize facts. Instead, it's an orientation to the world that we can cultivate, one that encourages reasoned skepticism, discourages haste, and counters our tendency to confirm our biases. Wineburg draws on surprising discoveries from an array of research and experiments--including surveys of students, recent attempts to update history curricula, and analyses of how historians, students, and even fact checkers approach online sources--to paint a picture of a dangerously mine-filled landscape, but one that, with care, attention, and awareness, we can all learn to navigate. It's easy to look around at the public consequences of historical ignorance and despair. Wineburg is here to tell us it doesn't have to be that way. The future of the past may rest on our screens. But its fate rests in our hands.",

It not only covers two of the standard paradigms (postpositivist and interpretive/constructivist) but also a relatively new emancipatory paradigm that is inclusive of the perspectives of feminists, ethnic/racial minorities, and persons with disabilities. In each chapter, Donna M. Mertens carefully explains a step of the research process from the literature review to types of research method to analysis and reporting of quantitative or qualitative approaches. As an added plus, she includes a sample study and abstract in each chapter to illustrate the concepts discussed in that chapter. To enhance your students reading, she has also included: - Chapter opening examples and lists of topics to consider - Boxed examples and points to consider - Sample studies in every chapter to illustrate key ideas - Sequence steps to guide each stage of the research process - End-of-chapter \"Questions and Answers for Discussion and Application\" to elicit further reflection of the material covered",

    "description": "In this pioneering and important book, Philippe Aries surveys children and their place in family life from the Middle Ages to the end of the eighteenth century. The first section of the book explores the gradual change from the medieval attitude to children, looked upon as small adults as soon as they were past infancy, to the seventeenth and eighteenth century awareness of the child as the focal point of family life. Aries goes on to examine the schooling of children and the development of modern educational methods. In the second section, he describes the metamorphosis of the family: at first the family was a unit in which everything was open and public and children mingled with adults in the social life of the community; eventually the family become a closed or private society, within which children had a unique and important status.",

In all, it is the clearest example of practise-what-you-preach that I have seen.\" Professor John Biggs This unusual, accessible and significant book begins each chapter by posing a question with which college and university teachers can be expected to identify; and then goes on to answer the question by presenting a series of examples; finally, each chapter closes with 'second thoughts', presenting a viewpoint somewhat distinct from that taken by John Cowan. This book will assist university teachers to plan and run innovative activities to enable their students to engage in effective reflective learning; it will help them adapt other teachers' work for use with their own students; and will give them a rationale for the place of reflective teaching and learning in higher education.",

    "description": "Expanding upon traditional class structure, William Fawcett Hill's Learning Through Discussion, Third Edition, enables students to develop critical thinking skills that are applicable to the classroom and the \"real world.\" Like Hill's original volume, the authors introduce the eight-step method--check-in, vocabulary, general statement of author's message, identification and discussion of major themes and sub-topics, application of material to other works and to self, and evaluation of group and individual performance. They next examine the criteria essential for developing an effective discussion group, which includes cooperative learning, active participation, and interaction. This combination of cognitive and personal skills the method employs allows the group to reach the primary goal: extended discussion and deeper understanding of the material. By empowering groups to foster a maximum level of learning, William Fawcett Hill's Learning Through Discussion is essential for students, scholars, and professionals in all disciplines.",

This book is arranged into three main thematic areas: Policy and Activism, Curriculum and Pedagogy, and Identity and Lived Experiences, each of which explores specific ideas and challenges found within the corresponding topic. The special features of this collection include a focus on the implications of sexuality for educational leadership as well as a multi-perspectival approach to the exploration of these concerns. This text will prove to be especially useful both to scholars who prepare future educational leaders and to practitioners who are seeking ways to deal with the complex social realities of their communities.",

The book addresses key issues across all phases of primary and secondary education, both in the UK and internationally. ICT, Pedagogy and the Curriculum looks at the relationship between ICT, paradigms of teaching and learning, and the way in which curriculum subjects are represented. Three principal areas are addressed: * the wider perception of ICT in society, culture and schooling * the challenges to pedagogy * the way in which ICT not only supports learning and teaching but changes the nature of curriculum subjects. The tensions between the use of technology to replicate traditional practices, and the possibilities for transforming the curriculum and pedagogy are explored, offering an original and distinctively critical perspective on the way in which we understand ICT in education. It will be of interest to all primary and secondary teachers and those in initial teacher training who are concerned about current technology initiatives in education and how to respond to them.",
